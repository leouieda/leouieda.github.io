          <p><strong>About:</strong> In April 2023, I applied and was selected for a Professor position at my
<em>alma mater</em>. As part of the selection process, I wrote an
<a href="https://github.com/leouieda/memorial">academic auto-biography (in Portuguese)</a>,

to find meaning in what I've accomplished, and plan where to invest my time

          <p><strong>About:</strong> After 2.5 years in Hawaiʻi, I was offered a position to join the Geophysics group
of the University of Liverpool's
<a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/earth-ocean-and-ecological-sciences/">Department
of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences</a> on 19 August 2019.
This was an exciting opportunity to start my own research group and
navigate the UK system, which was entirely new to me.
I spent 4 years at Liverpool, with great friends and colleagues, and had
an overall good time.
But I felt that the time had come to return home to Brazil, to be closer
to family and also to once more be a part of a public university system
that has a strong social justice agenda, like we have in Brazil.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> The title of "Livre Docente" is a form <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation">habilitation</a>, which
is the highest degree that can be earned after a PhD. At Universidade de
São Paulo, this involves written and teaching exams and the defense of
a thesis (see the DOI link) and a <a
href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28737800">"memorial"</a> (in
portuguese), which is a long form narrative CV that includes reflections on
our experiences.
The thesis is a compilation of the work of the wonderful graduate
researchers Santiago Soler, India Uppal, and Gelson Souza-Junior.
My examination committee was composed of <a

of exams, but also very rewarding to see all of my effort being recognized
by my peers and seniors.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present methodological improvements to forward modeling and regional
inversion of satellite gravity data. For this purpose, we developed two
open-source software projects. The first is a C language suite of
command-line programs called Tesseroids. The programs calculate the
gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor of a spherical
prism, or tesseroid. Tesseroids implements and extends an adaptive
discretization algorithm to automatically ensure the accuracy of the
computations. Our numerical experiments show that, to achieve the same
level of accuracy, the gravitational acceleration components require
finner discretization than the potential. In turn, the gradient tensor
requires finner discretization still than the acceleration. The second
open-source project is Fatiando a Terra, a Python language library for
inversion, forward modeling, data processing, and visualization. The
library allows the user to combine the forward modeling and inversion
tools to implement new inversion methods. The gravity forward modeling
tools include an implementation of the algorithm used in the Tesseroids
software. We combined the inversion and tesseroid forward modeling
utilities of Fatiando a Terra to develop a new method for fast non-linear
gravity inversion. The method estimates the depth of the crust-mantle
interface (the Moho) based on observed gravity data using a spherical
Earth approximation. We extended the computationally efficient Bott's
method to include smoothness regularization and use tesseroids instead
right rectangular prisms. The inversion is controlled by three
hyper-parameters: the regularization parameter, the density-contrast
between the real Earth and the reference model (the Normal Earth), and
the depth of the Moho of the Normal Earth. We employ two cross-validation
procedures to automatically estimate these parameters. Tests on synthetic
data confirm the capability of the proposed method to estimate smoothly
varying Moho depths and the three hyper-parameters. Finally, we applied
the inversion method developed to produce a Moho depth model for South
America. The estimated Moho depth model fits the gravity data and
seismological Moho depth estimates in the oceanic areas and the central
and eastern portions of the continent. We observe large misfits in the
Andes region, where Moho depth is largest. In Amazon, Solimões, and
Paraná Basins, the model fits the observed gravity but disagrees with
seismological estimates. These discrepancies suggest the existence of
density-anomalies in the crust or upper mantle, as has been suggested in
the literature.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> I did my Master's degree in Geophysics at the Observatório Nacional in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under the supervision of <a
href="https://www.pinga-lab.org/people/barbosa.html">Valéria C. F.
Barbosa</a>. I started in March 2010 and defended my dissertation in
October 2011.
The method that we developed is implemented in the software
<a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a>.
The dissertation was later published as the paper
"<a href="https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2011-0388.1">Robust 3D gravity gradient inversion by planting anomalous densities</a> (2012)"
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We have developed a new gravity gradient inversion method for estimating
a 3D density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of rectangular
prisms. Our method consists of an iterative algorithm that does not
require the solution of an equation system. Instead, the solution grows
systematically around user-specified prismatic elements, called "seeds",
with given density contrasts. Each seed can be assigned a different
density-contrast value, allowing the interpretation of multiple sources
with different density contrasts and that produce interfering signals. In
real world scenarios, some sources might not be targeted for the
interpretation. Thus, we developed a robust procedure that neither
requires the isolation of the signal of the targeted sources prior to the
inversion nor requires substantial prior information about the
nontargeted sources. In our iterative algorithm, the estimated sources
grow by the accretion of prisms in the periphery of the current estimate.
In addition, only the columns of the sensitivity matrix corresponding to
the prisms in the periphery of the current estimate are needed for the
computations. Therefore, the individual columns of the sensitivity matrix
can be calculated on demand and deleted after an accretion takes place,
greatly reducing the demand for computer memory and processing time.
Tests on synthetic data show the ability of our method to correctly
recover the geometry of the targeted sources, even when interfering
signals produced by nontargeted sources are present. Inverting the data
from an airborne gravity gradiometry survey flown over the iron ore
province of Quadrilátero Ferrífero, southeastern Brazil, we estimated a
compact iron ore body that is in agreement with geologic information and
previous interpretations.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> My Bachelor's degree in Geophysics is from the Universidade de São Paulo,
Brazil, where I studied from 2004 until 2009. I did an undergraduate
research project and eventually my thesis under the supervision of
<a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/6704246490515612">Naomi Ussami</a>.
This was when I started development of the software
<a href="https://github.com/leouieda/tesseroids">Tesseroids</a> and the
research that lead to the paper which is the first part of my PhD thesis:
"<a href="https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2015-0204.1">Tesseroids: forward modeling gravitational fields in spherical coordinates</a> (2016)".
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The GOCE satellite mission has the objective of measuring the Earths
gravitational field with an unprecedented accuracy through the
measurement of the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). The data provided by
this mission could be used to study large areas, where the flat Earth
approximation can have its limitations. In these cases the modeling could
be done with tesseroids, also called spherical prisms, in order to take
the Earths curvature into account. The GGT caused by a tesseroid can be
calculated with numerical integration methods, such as the Gauss-Legendre
Quadrature (GLQ). In the current project, a computer program was
developed for the direct calculation of the GGT using the GLQ. The
accuracy of this implementation was evaluated by comparing its results
with the result of analytical formulas for the special case of a
spherical cap. Next, the developed program was used to calculate the
differences in the GGT caused by the flat Earth approximation. These
differences reach are up to 30% in the Tzz component for a 50 deg x 50
deg x 10 km model. Finally, the computer program was used to calculate
the effect caused by the topographic masses on the GGT at 250 km altitude
for the Paraná basin region. In regions of large topographical
variations, the components of the GGT due to the topographic masses have
amplitudes of the same order of magnitude as the GGT components due to
density anomalies in the interior of the crust and mantle.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The magnetization that is locked in certain minerals at the time of their
formation is one of the few gateways we have to the Earth's distant past.
By measuring the magnetization of certain rocks we are able to determine
properties about the Earth's magnetic field in the past, which provides
crucial information about our planet's climate history and the movement of
the plates that make up the outermost layer of the Earth. For decades,
researchers have only been able to make measurements of the average
magnetic field of each rock sample, which can lead to large uncertainties
in our estimates or even having to discard entire samples. Recent advances
in technology are allowing us to make measurements in such detail that we
may soon be able to distinguish the magnetic fields of the individual
minerals that make up the rock sample. This new technology opens the door
to using methods normally applied to national or continental scale
geophysical surveys to micrometer scale data. There is still much to be
explored and refined before this can be achieved. This collaboration will
bring together experts from both large scale geophysics and micrometer
scale paleomagnetism to explore the possibilities and help define future
directions of research.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is open source software infrastructure used
in the Earth, ocean, and planetary geosciences. GMT supports other software
platforms and delivers data processing and visualizations (graphs, charts,
maps) that promote new discoveries and their dissemination to society. The
primary goal of this project is to transition GMT to a governance structure
that includes a broader and more diverse community of developers. This
project will (1) recruit and train new and diverse developers, (2) build a
broad and sustainable developer community, and (3) modernize, simplify, and
strengthen the GMT software. The first two tasks are critical social
activities while the last is technical, involving code hardening,
interoperability improvements, interface modernization, documentation
completion, and data upgrades. This project will provide training in
cutting-edge computational software development and data analysis, along
with engaging undergraduate students in scientifically challenging tasks
related to the GMT project. The project will also facilitate ongoing user
training and developer workshops.
This project is based on a vision for the future of GMT that incorporates
how governance, communications, developer recruitment and training will
evolve in the next decade. The project will design and implement a
sustainable model for GMT maintenance and curation, and execute a series of
essential technical improvements. These improvements will address a)
automated testing and verification of results, b) development of
GMT-powered software libraries in other languages (Python, MATLAB, Julia)
and c) the recruitment of new and enthusiastic developers so that GMT may
continue to be maintained and evolve in a changing computational landscape.
In addition, GMT products such as coastline maps will be revised with
modern high-resolution data as well as technical documentation of how
updates are produced. Finally, this project will advance GMT to a
sustainable environment that results in lower maintenance, greater
confidence in GMT products, and a more engaged community of users and
developers.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Research under the EarthScope umbrella involves both data processing and
display of results. The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is a set of scientific
analysis and plotting modules that are widely used in the Earth Sciences,
particularly because they allow for specialized processing and imaging
suitable for the geosciences. GMT is a long-lived (~30 years) and robust
NSF-funded software toolset that originated in the ocean sciences but has
spread to all aspects of the geosciences and beyond. This project will add
numerous enhancements to GMT, including a much simplified usage syntax
called modern mode. In addition, new modules for simplifying the creation
of animations, 3-D stacking and interpolation of grids, conversion of
imagery for placement in Google Earth, and greatly improved interactive
documentation will be built during the project.
The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) scripting has remained remarkably similar
over its 30 years of existence. Because thousands of GMT classic scripts
have been written, making major changes has been problematic, even if such
changes would simplify its usage. The proposed modern mode will solve this
dilemma as it introduces two new commands (begin and end) that starts and
end a modern mode session. Hence it is not possible to accidentally enter
modern mode without the use of those commands, thus allowing all existing
GMT scripts to run unchanged. Once in modern mode, the required syntax will
be simplified to avoid repetitive options and the user will no longer be
responsible for assembling a composite PostScript file. The default output
format will be PDF but more than one format may be selected, including
standard raster image formats. Improved interactive documentation will be
added to showcase modern mode (while maintaining the documentation for
classic mode). To strengthen EarthScope science there will be new modules
for 3-D grid stacking and interpolation, KML image quadtree building for
Google Earth, and a new animation module that vastly simplifies the task of
building scientific animations. It is anticipated that UNAVCO will assist
with annual workshops aimed at EarthScope scientists using GMT in shell,
MATLAB, or Python environments.

</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Micropaleomagnetic analysis offers a path to high-precision reconstructions
of ancient magnetic fields from terrestrial and space-returned samples by
inverting the vertical stray field of individual particles to recover their
magnetic moments through the use of magnetic microscopes. Constraining such
inversions requires a detailed understanding of how domain state influences
the dipolar and non-dipolar components of the stray field with distance.
Here, we use micromagnetic solutions of remanent states in real, irregular
sub- to near-micron magnetite particle morphologies to calculate vertical
stray fields at various heights, evaluating how dipolar and non-dipolar
signals can be recovered with both simple Cartesian dipole and multidipolar
models in the presence and absence of noise. Our results show that
single-domain and single-vortex state (SV) grains produce strong dipolar
anomalies that attenuate rapidly, limiting reliable detection to
observation heights below ∼1μm for 5nT noise or ∼0.5μm for 50nT noise.
Larger SV or multivortex grains remain detectable to ∼5-10μm but with
reduced moment fidelity. Multipolar components decay orders of magnitude
faster than the dipole and are quickly lost in noise at practical
distances. Dipole-only inversions yield stable, accurate results beyond
∼2μm, while multipolar fits can improve near-surface accuracy but add
significant uncertainty in noisy data. Because strongly non-dipolar
anomalies observed at heights ≥1-2μm may arise from large multidomain
grains or from the combined response of short- and long-wave signals of
clusters of particles, they should be interpreted with caution. We
highlight the need to minimize sensor noise, optimize stand-off distance,
and carefully interpret signals for robust micropaleomagnetic measurement.

<a href"https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GC011082">original method</a> using an
iterative scheme to strip the effects of larger dipoles from the signal and
a non-linear inversion step. The result is that the new method is able to
cope with much denser distributions of magnetic particles.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Scientists often study entire samples to understand their overall
properties, but this approach can miss important details. To get a clearer
picture, researchers are improving methods that focus on smaller regions of
a sample. In paleomagnetism, a field that studies the Earth's ancient
magnetic field, magnetic microscopy allows scientists to examine tiny areas
with high precision. In this study, we use magnetic microscopy data to
determine the direction of magnetization in samples. To do this, we apply
a mathematical method called Euler deconvolution, which helps solve complex
calculations and reduce uncertainty. We also refine our results with an
additional step that improves accuracy and removes unwanted signals. We
tested this approach on both simulated and real data. Our results show that
this new method can detect weaker magnetic sources and accurately determine
the direction of magnetization. When applied to real samples, it
successfully identified their original magnetic direction. This represents
an important step in using magnetic microscopy for paleomagnetic research.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A recent editorial in Nature Methods, "Giving Software its Due",
described challenges related to the development of research software and
highlighted, in particular, the challenge of software publication and
citation. Here, we call attention to a system that we have developed that
enables community-driven software review, publication, and
citation: The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-source
project and an open access journal that provides a light-weight
publishing process for research software. Focused on and based in open
platforms and on a community of contributors, JOSS evidently satisfies a
pressing need, having already published more than 500 articles in
approximately three years of existence.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is the first paper of India's PhD thesis. It was motivated by our desire to improve the currently available magnetic data products available for Antarctica. We realised that more sophisticated methods of interpolating and joining the different survey data were needed and that equivalent sources was likely the way forward. These results serve as the basis for further exploration into the challenging Antarctic magnetic datasets.

</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Potential field data often require interpolation onto a regular grid at constant height before further analysis. A widely used approach for this is the equivalent sources technique, which has been adapted over time to improve its computational efficiency and accuracy of the predictions. However, many of these approaches still face challenges, including border effects in the predictions or reliance on a stabilising parameter. To address these limitations, we introduce the dual-layer gradient-boosted equivalent sources to: (1) use a dual-layer approach to improve the predictions of long-wavelength signals and reduce border effect; (2) use block-averaging and the gradient-boosted equivalent sources method to reduce the computational load; (3) apply Block K-Fold cross-validation to guide optimal parameter selection for the model. The proposed method was tested on both synthetic datasets and the ICEGRAV aeromagnetic dataset to evaluate the methods ability to interpolate and upward continue onto a regular grid at constant height as well as predict the amplitude of the anomalous field from total-field anomaly data. The dual-layer approach proved superior to the single-layer approach at predicting both short- and long-wavelength signals, particularly in the presence of truncated long-wavelength anomalies. The use of block-averaging and the gradient-boosting method make our dual-layer approach computationally light, being able to grid over 400,000 data points in under 2 minutes on a moderate workstation computer.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This came about from discussions between myself, Ricardo, Ualisson, and Gelson about deriving the number of particles that are needed to realistically recover the bias field of the Earth. The motivation was to provide a guideline for our magnetic microscopy work so we know how many measurements are needed to get a statistically reasonable estimate of the field. Ualisson took leadership of the project and produced this great bit of research.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Magmatic rocks record ambient magnetic fields during cooling, preserving them for billions of years through thermoremanent magnetization (TRM). TRM accuracy depends on particle size, shape, magnetic properties, and the number of particles available to record the field. While traditionally interpreted via Neél’s single-domain theory, most particles exist in a vortex state, where complex magnetic structures require numerical modeling. We show that in strong fields (>10 μT), a few thousand nanoscopic vortex-state particles can record TRM with less than 1% error, regardless of shape. For weaker fields, morphology plays a crucial role, with spherical and oblate particles performing best. These findings challenge assumptions about particle requirements for faithful TRM recording and highlight the influence of grain shape in paleomagnetic studies. Our results justify using smaller geological samples and magnetic microscopy to reconstruct ancient magnetic fields with precision.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> The main idea for this paper came about during an potential-field methods class which Leo took in 2012 with his then PhD supervisor Prof. Valéria C. F. Barbosa. While learning about the Euler deconvolution method, which is a speciality of Valéria, Leo connected it with the geodetic network adjustment theory he had been taught by Prof. Spiros Pagiatakis during an exchange program at York University, Canada, in 2008. An initial prototype was developed in 2012 but there were still some rough edges and the project was shelved to make way for other more urgent projects at the time. Leo returned to this every few years, making slow progress, and involving Vanderlei in the planning and discussion of the theory. In 2024, co-authors Gelson, India, and Vanderlei joined Leo for a sprint to finish the method and produce this paper. The paper was submitted to Geophysical Journal International in December 2024.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Earth scientists can estimate the depth of certain rocks beneath Earth's surface by measuring the small disturbances that they cause in the Earth's gravity and magnetic fields. A popular method for this is Euler deconvolution, which is widely available in geoscience software and can be run quickly on a standard computer. Unfortunately, Euler deconvolution has some shortcomings: 1) the approximate shape of the rocks must be known, for example, a sphere or a wide flat slab, represented by the structural index 2) the depth of the rocks is not well estimated when there is noise in our data, which is a common occurrence. We propose a new method, Euler inversion, which fixes some of the shortcomings of Euler deconvolution by using more adequate (and complex) mathematics. Our method is less sensitive to noise in the data and is also able to determine the approximate shape of the source (the structural index). Euler inversion is also fast to execute on a standard computer, making it a practical alternative to Euler deconvolution on an Earth scientists toolbox.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Very small magnetic particles in rocks and other materials can store
information about what the Earth’s magnetic field was like in the past. But
not all particles are good recorders of this magnetic information, and some
may have recorded different overlapping directions and strengths. So it is
important to measure each particle separately in order to identify and
separate the good recorders from the bad ones. A device called a "quantum
diamond microscope" is able to measure the magnetic field near the surface
of a rock sample at microscopic scale. We propose a new method for
processing data from this microscope that is able to find out the
individual magnetizations of large amounts of small magnetic particles
automatically. We created a computer program to execute the method, which
calculates the 3D position and magnetization of each particle using the
simple model of a magnetic dipole. We tested the method on simulated data,
using fake magnetic particles for which we know the correct magnetization
and position, and real data, both of which showed good results in most
cases. The method we created has the potential to enable the widespread
study of the magnetism of natural materials with more detail than before.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The equivalent source technique is a powerful and widely used method for
processing gravity and magnetic data. Nevertheless, its major drawback is
the large computational cost in terms of processing time and computer
memory. We present two techniques for reducing the computational cost of
equivalent source processing: block-averaging source locations and the
gradient-boosted equivalent source algorithm. Through block-averaging,
we reduce the number of source coefficients that must be estimated
while retaining the minimum desired resolution in the final processed
data. With the gradient boosting method, we estimate the sources
coefficients in small batches along overlapping windows, allowing us to
reduce the computer memory requirements arbitrarily to conform to the
constraints of the available hardware. We show that the combination of
block-averaging and gradient-boosted equivalent sources is capable of
producing accurate interpolations through tests against synthetic data.
Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by gridding a
gravity dataset covering Australia with over 1.7 million observations
using a modest personal computer.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Scientific software is usually created to acquire, analyze, model, and
visualize data. As such, many software libraries include sample datasets
in their distributions for use in documentation, tests, benchmarks, and
workshops. A common approach is to include smaller datasets in the GitHub
repository directly and package them with the source and binary
distributions (e.g., scikit-learn and scikit-image do this). As data
files increase in size, it becomes unfeasible to store them in GitHub
repositories. Thus, larger datasets require writing code to download the
files from a remote server to the user's computer. The same problem is
faced by scientists using version control to manage their research
projects. While downloading a data file over HTTPS can be done easily
with modern Python libraries, it is not trivial to manage a set of files,
keep them updated, and check for corruption. For example, scikit-learn,
Cartopy, and PyVista all include code dedicated to this particular task.
Instead of scientists and library authors recreating the same code, it
would be best to have a minimalistic and easy to set up tool for fetching
and maintaining data files.
Pooch is a Python library that fills this gap. It manages a data registry
(containing file names, SHA-256 cryptographic hashes, and download URLs) by
downloading files from one or more remote servers and storing them in a local
data cache. Pooch is written in pure Python and has minimal dependencies. It
can be easily installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and conda-forge on
a wide range of Python versions: 2.7 (up to Pooch 0.6.0) and from 3.5 to 3.8.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This paper marks the release of GMT version 6. Most of the work done for
this release had the goal of reducing barriers to entry for new users.
The user experience as a whole has been improved and these changes are
the foundation for my work on PyGMT. The development of the new modern
mode was funded by our NSF EarthScope grant.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software is ubiquitous in the Earth and
Ocean sciences. As a cross-platform tool producing high quality maps and
figures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world.
The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s,
despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning
curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike.
Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break
compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT
version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new "modern mode" to
complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls
"classic mode". GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended
upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage
of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used
global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw
subplots, place insets, and create animations.

</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a new methodology to compute the gravitational fields
generated by tesseroids (spherical prisms) whose density varies with
depth according to an arbitrary continuous function. It approximates the
gravitational fields through the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature along with two
discretization algorithms that automatically control its accuracy by
adaptively dividing the tesseroid into smaller ones. The first one is a
preexisting two dimensional adaptive discretization algorithm that
reduces the errors due to the distance between the tesseroid and the
computation point. The second is a new density-based discretization
algorithm that decreases the errors introduced by the variation of the
density function with depth. The amount of divisions made by each
algorithm is indirectly controlled by two parameters: the distance-size
ratio and the delta ratio. We have obtained analytical solutions for a
spherical shell with radially variable density and compared them to the
results of the numerical model for linear, exponential, and sinusoidal
density functions. These comparisons allowed us to obtain optimal values
for the distance-size and delta ratios that yield an accuracy of 0.1% of
the analytical solutions. The resulting optimal values of distance-size
ratio for the gravitational potential and its gradient are 1 and 2.5,
respectively. The density-based discretization algorithm produces no
discretizations in the linear density case, but a delta ratio of 0.1 is
needed for the exponential and the sinusoidal density functions. These
values can be extrapolated to cover most common use cases. However, the
distance-size and delta ratios can be configured by the user to increase
the accuracy of the results at the expense of computational speed.
Lastly, we apply this new methodology to model the Neuquén Basin, a
foreland basin in Argentina with a maximum depth of over 5000 m, using an
exponential density function.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> An efficient forward modeling algorithm for calculation of gravitational
fields in spherical coordinates is developed for 3D large‐scale gravity
inversion problems. 3D Gauss‐Legendre quadrature (GLQ) is used to
calculate the gravitational fields of mass distributions discretized into
tesseroids. Equivalence relations in the kernel matrix of the
forward‐modeling are exploited to decrease storage and computation time.
The numerical tests demonstrate that the computation time of the proposed
algorithm is reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude, and the
memory requirement is reduced by N'λ times compared with the traditional
GLQ method, where N'λ is the number of the model elements in the
longitudinal direction. These significant improvements in computational
efficiency and storage make it possible to calculate and store the dense
Jacobian matrix in 3D large‐scale gravity inversions. The equivalence
relations can be applied to the Taylor series method or combined with the
adaptive discretization to ensure high accuracy. To further illustrate
the capability of the algorithm, we present a regional synthetic example.
The inverted results show density distributions consistent with the
actual model. The computation took about 6.3 hours and 0.88 GB of memory
compared with about a dozen days and 245.86 GB for the traditional 3D GLQ
method. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to the gravity field
derived from the latest lunar gravity model GL1500E. 3D density
distributions of the Imbrium and Serenitatis basins are obtained, and
high‐density bodies are found at the depths 10‐60 km, likely indicating a
significant uplift of the high‐density mantle beneath the two mascon
basins.

</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Verde is a Python library for gridding spatial data using different
Green's functions. It differs from the radial basis functions in
<code>scipy.interpolate</code> by providing an API inspired by
scikit-learn. The Verde API should be familiar to scikit-learn users but
is tweaked to work with spatial data, which has Cartesian or geographic
coordinates and multiple data components instead of an <code>X</code>
feature matrix and <code>y</code> label vector. The library also includes
more specialized Green's functions, utilities for trend estimation and
data decimation (which are often required prior to gridding), and more.
Some of these interpolation and data processing methods already exist in
the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), a command-line program popular in the
Earth Sciences. However, there are no model selection tools in GMT and it
can be difficult to separate parts of the processing that are done
internally by its modules. Verde is designed to be modular, easily
extended, and integrated into the scientific Python ecosystem. It can be
used to implement new interpolation methods by subclassing the
<code>verde.base.BaseGridder</code> class, requiring only the
implementation of the new Green's function. For example, it is currently
being used to develop a method for interpolation of 3-component GPS data.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Estimating the relief of the Moho from gravity data is a computationally
intensive non-linear inverse problem. What is more, the modeling must take the
Earths curvature into account when the study area is of regional scale or
greater. We present a regularized non-linear gravity inversion method that has
a low computational footprint and employs a spherical Earth approximation. To
achieve this, we combine the highly efficient Bott's method with smoothness
regularization and a discretization of the anomalous Moho into tesseroids
(spherical prisms). The computational efficiency of our method is attained by
harnessing the fact that all matrices involved are sparse. The inversion
results are controlled by three hyper-parameters: the regularization parameter,
the anomalous Moho density-contrast, and the reference Moho depth. We
estimate the regularization parameter using the method of hold-out
cross-validation. Additionally, we estimate the density-contrast and the
reference depth using knowledge of the Moho depth at certain points. We apply
the proposed method to estimate the Moho depth for the South American
continent using satellite gravity data and seismological data. The final Moho
model is in accordance with previous gravity-derived models and seismological
data. The misfit to the gravity and seismological data is worse in the Andes
and best in oceanic areas, central Brazil and Patagonia, and along the
Atlantic coast. Similarly to previous results, the model suggests a thinner
crust of 30-35 km under the Andean foreland basins. Discrepancies with the
seismological data are greatest in the Guyana Shield, the central Solimões
and Amazonas Basins, the Paraná Basin, and the Borborema province. These
differences suggest the existence of crustal or mantle density anomalies that
were unaccounted for during gravity data processing.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Open any text book about seismic data processing and you will inevitably
find a section about the normal moveout (NMO) correction. When applied to
a common midpoint (CMP) section, the correction is supposed to turn the
hyperbola associated with a reflection into a straight horizontal line.
What most text books won't tell you is <strong>how, exactly, do you apply
this equation to the data?</strong>

Read on and I'll explain step-by-step how the algorithm for NMO
correction from Yilmaz (2001) works and how to implement it in Python.

</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present the open-source software Tesseroids, a set of command-line
programs to perform the forward modeling of gravitational fields in
spherical coordinates.  The software is implemented in the C programming
language and uses tesseroids (spherical prisms) for the discretization of
the subsurface mass distribution.  The gravitational fields of tesseroids
are calculated numerically using the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ).  We
have improved upon an adaptive discretization algorithm to guarantee the
accuracy of the GLQ integration.  Our implementation of adaptive
discretization uses a "stack" based algorithm instead of recursion to
achieve more control over execution errors and corner cases.  The
algorithm is controlled by a scalar value called the distance-size ratio
(D) that determines the accuracy of the integration as well as the
computation time.  We determined optimal values of D for the
gravitational potential, gravitational acceleration, and gravity gradient
tensor by comparing the computed tesseroids effects with those of a
homogeneous spherical shell.  The values required for a maximum relative
error of 0.1% of the shell effects are D = 1 for the gravitational
potential, D = 1.5 for the gravitational acceleration, and D = 8 for the
gravity gradients.  Contrary to previous assumptions, our results show
that the potential and its first and second derivatives require different
values of D to achieve the same accuracy. These values were incorporated
as defaults in the software.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Airborne gravity gradiometry data have been recently used in mining
surveys to map the 3D geometry of ore deposits. This task can be achieved
by different gravity-gradient inversion methods, many of which use a
voxel-based discretization of the Earth's subsurface. To produce a unique
and stable solution, an inversion method introduces particular
constraints. One constraining inversion introduces a depth-weighting
function in the first-order Tikhonov regularization imposing a smoothing
on the density-contrast distributions that are not restricted to
near-surface regions. Another gravity-gradient inversion, the method of
planting anomalous densities, imposes compactness and sharp boundaries on
the density-contrast distributions. We used these two inversion methods
to invert the airborne gravity-gradient data over the iron-ore deposit at
the southern flank of the Gandarela syncline in Quadrilátero Ferrífero
(Brazil). Because these methods differ from each other in the particular
constraint used, the estimated 3D density-contrast distributions reveal
different geologic features of ore deposit. The depth-weighting smoothing
inversion reveals variable dip directions along the strike of the
retrieved iron-ore body. The planting anomalous density inversion
estimates a compact iron-ore mass with a single density contrast, which
reveals a variable volume of the iron ore along its strike increasing
towards the hinge zone of the Gandarela syncline which is the zone of
maximum compression. The combination of the geologic features inferred
from each estimate leads to a synergistic effect, revealing that the
iron-ore deposit is strongly controlled by the Gandarela syncline.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We have developed a fast total-field anomaly inversion to estimate the
magnetization direction of multiple sources with approximately spherical
shapes and known centres. Our method is an overdetermined inverse problem
that can be applied to interpret multiple sources with different but
homogeneous magnetization directions. It requires neither the prior
computation of any transformation-like reduction to the pole nor the use
of regularly spaced data on a horizontal grid. The method contains
flexibility to be implemented as a linear or non-linear inverse problem,
which results, respectively, in a least-squares or robust estimate of the
components of the magnetization vector of the sources. Applications to
synthetic data show the robustness of our method against interfering
anomalies and errors in the location of the sources' centre. Besides, we
show the feasibility of applying the upward continuation to interpret
non-spherical sources. Applications to field data over the Goiás alkaline
province (GAP), Brazil, show the good performance of our method in
estimating geologically meaningful magnetization directions. The results
obtained for a region of the GAP, near to the alkaline complex of
Diorama, suggest the presence of non-outcropping sources marked by strong
remanent magnetization with inclination and declination close to −70.35
and −19.81°, respectively. This estimated magnetization direction leads
to predominantly positive reduced-to-the-pole anomalies, even for other
region of the GAP, in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás.
These results show that the non-outcropping sources near to the alkaline
complex of Diorama have almost the same magnetization direction of those
ones in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás, strongly
suggesting that these sources have been emplaced in the crust within
almost the same geological time interval.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Quadrilátero Ferrífero in southeastern Brazil hosts one of the
largest concentrations of lateritic iron ore deposits in the world. Our
study area is over the southern flank of the Gandarela syncline which is
one of the regional synclines of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero. The
Gandarela syncline is considered the Brazilian megastructure with the
highest perspectives for iron ore exploration. Most of the iron-ore
deposits from the Quadrilátero Ferrífero are non-outcropping bodies
hosted in the oxidized, metamorphosed and heterogeneously deformed banded
iron formations. Therefore, the assessment of the 3D geometry of the
iron-ore body is of the utmost importance for estimating reserves and
production development planning. We carried out a quantitative
interpretation of the iron-ore deposit of the southern flank of the
Gandarela syncline using a 3D inversion of airborne gravity-gradient data
to estimate the shape of the iron-ore mineralization. The retrieved body
is characterized by a high-density zone associated with the
northeast-elongated iron formation. The thickness and the width of the
retrieved iron-ore body vary along its strike increasing southwestward.
The presence of a large volume of iron ore in the southwest portion of
the study area may be due to the hinge zone of the Gandarela syncline,
which is the zone of maximum compression. Our estimated iron-ore mass
reveals variable dip directions. In the southernmost, central and
northernmost portions of the study area, the estimated iron body dips,
respectively, inwards, vertically and outwards with respect to the
syncline axis. Previous geological mapping indicated continuous
mineralization. However, our result suggests a quasi-continuous iron-ore
body. In the central part of the study area, the estimated iron-ore body
is segmented into two parts. This breakup may be related to the
northwest-trending faults, which are perpendicular to the
northeast-trending axis of the Gandarela syncline. Our estimated iron-ore
mass agrees reasonably well with the information provided from the
lithologic logging data of drill holes. In this geophysical study, the
estimated iron-ore reserves are approximately 3 billion tons.

function of the x- and y-coordinates of the observations. By assuming any
tentative structural index (defining the geometry of the sources), our
method automatically locates plateaus, on the maps of the horizontal
coordinate estimates, indicating consistent estimates that are very close
to the true corresponding coordinates. These plateaus are located in the
neighborhood of the highest values of the anomaly and show a contrasting
behavior with those estimates that form inclined planes at the anomaly
borders. The plateaus are automatically located on the maps of the
horizontal coordinate estimates by fitting a first-degree polynomial to
these estimates in a moving-window scheme spanning all estimates. The
positions where the angular coefficient estimates are closest to zero
identify the plateaus of the horizontal coordinate estimates. The sample
means of these horizontal coordinate estimates are the best horizontal
location estimates. After mapping each plateau, our method takes as the
best structural index the one that yields the minimum correlation between
the total-field anomaly and the estimated base level over each plateau.
By using the estimated structural index for each plateau, our approach
extracts the vertical coordinate estimates over the corresponding
plateau. The sample means of these estimates are the best depth location
estimates in our method. When applied to synthetic data, our method
yielded good results if the bodies produce weak- and mid-interfering
anomalies. A test on real data over intrusions in the Goiás Alkaline
Province, Brazil, retrieved sphere-like sources suggesting 3D bodies.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We have developed a new cost-effective method for processing
large-potential-field data sets via the equivalent-layer technique. In
this approach, the equivalent layer is divided into a regular grid of
equivalent-source windows. Inside each window, the physical-property
distribution is described by a bivariate polynomial. Hence, the
physical-property distribution within the equivalent layer is assumed to
be a piecewise polynomial function defined on a set of equivalent-source
windows. We perform any linear transformation of a large set of data as
follows. First, we estimate the polynomial coefficients of all
equivalent-source windows by using a linear regularized inversion.
Second, we transform the estimated polynomial coefficients of all windows
into the physical-property distribution within the whole equivalent
layer. Finally, we premultiply this distribution by the matrix of Green's
functions associated with the desired transformation to obtain the
transformed data. The regularized inversion deals with a linear system of
equations with dimensions based on the total number of polynomial
coefficients within all equivalent-source windows. This contrasts with
the classical approach of directly estimating the physical-property
distribution within the equivalent layer, which leads to a system based
on the number of data. Because the number of data is much larger than the
number of polynomial coefficients, the proposed polynomial representation
of the physical-property distribution within an equivalent layer
drastically reduces the number of parameters to be estimated. By
comparing the total number of floating-point operations required to
estimate an equivalent layer via our method with the classical approach,
both formulated with Cholesky's decomposition, we can verify that the
computation time required for building the linear system and for solving
the linear inverse problem can be reduced by as many as three and four
orders of magnitude, respectively. Applications to synthetic and real
data show that our method performs the standard linear transformations of
potential-field data accurately.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We have developed a new gravity gradient inversion method for estimating
a 3D density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of rectangular
prisms. Our method consists of an iterative algorithm that does not
require the solution of an equation system. Instead, the solution grows
systematically around user-specified prismatic elements, called “seeds,”
with given density contrasts. Each seed can be assigned a different
density-contrast value, allowing the interpretation of multiple sources
with different density contrasts and that produce interfering signals. In
real world scenarios, some sources might not be targeted for the
interpretation. Thus, we developed a robust procedure that neither
requires the isolation of the signal of the targeted sources prior to the
inversion nor requires substantial prior information about the
nontargeted sources. In our iterative algorithm, the estimated sources
grow by the accretion of prisms in the periphery of the current estimate.
In addition, only the columns of the sensitivity matrix corresponding to
the prisms in the periphery of the current estimate are needed for the
computations. Therefore, the individual columns of the sensitivity matrix
can be calculated on demand and deleted after an accretion takes place,
greatly reducing the demand for computer memory and processing time.
Tests on synthetic data show the ability of our method to correctly
recover the geometry of the targeted sources, even when interfering
signals produced by nontargeted sources are present. Inverting the data
from an airborne gravity gradiometry survey flown over the iron ore
province of Quadrilátero Ferrífero, southeastern Brazil, we estimated a
compact iron ore body that is in agreement with geologic information and
previous interpretations.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We developed a method that drastically reduces the number of the source
location estimates in Euler deconvolution to only one per anomaly. We use
the analytical estimators of the Euler solutions. Our approach consists in
detecting automatically the regions of the anomaly producing consistent
estimates of the source horizontal coordinates. These regions form plateaus
in the horizontal coordinate estimates using any structural index (defining
the geometry of the sources). We identify these plateaus by fitting a
first-degree polynomial to the horizontal coordinate estimates with a
moving-window operator which spans these estimates. The places where the
angular-coefficients estimates are closest to zero identify the plateaus of
the horizontal coordinate estimates where consistent estimates of the
horizontal source positions are found. The sample means of these horizontal
coordinate estimates are the best estimates. The best structural index is
the one that yields the minimum correlation between the total-field anomaly
and the estimated base level over each plateau. By using the estimated
structural index for each plateau, we extract the depth estimates over the
corresponding plateau. The sample means of these estimates are the best
depth estimates. Test on real data over alkaline bodies, central Brazil,
retrieved sphere-like sources suggesting 3D bodies.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Geophysics is the science of using physical observations of the Earth to
infer its inner structure. Generally, this is done with a variety of
numerical modeling techniques and inverse problems. The development of new
algorithms usually involves copy and pasting of code, which leads to errors
and poor code reuse. Fatiando a Terra is a Python library that aims to
automate common tasks and unify the modeling pipeline inside of the Python
language. This allows users to replace the traditional shell scripting with
more versatile and powerful Python scripting. The library can also be used
as an API for developing stand-alone programs. Algorithms implemented in
Fatiando a Terra can be combined to build upon existing functionality. This
flexibility facilitates prototyping of new algorithms and quickly building
interactive teaching exercises. In the future, we plan to continuously
implement sample problems to help teach geophysics as well as classic and
state-of-the-art algorithms.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present an improvement to the method of 3D gravity gradient inversion by
planting anomalous densities. This method estimates a density-contrast
distribution defined on a grid of right-rectangular prisms. Instead of
solving large equation systems, the method uses a systematic search
algorithm to grow the solution, one prism at a time, around user-specified
prisms called “seeds”. These seeds have known density contrasts and the
solution is constrained to be concentrated around the seeds as well as have
their density contrasts. Thus, prior geologic and geophysical information
are incorporated into the inverse problem through the seeds. However, this
leads to a strong dependence of the solution on the correct location,
density contrast, and number of seeds used. Our improvement to this method
consists of using the “shape-of-anomaly” data-misfit function in
conjunction with the l2-norm data-misfit function. The shape-of-anomaly
function measures the different in shape between the observed and predicted
data and is insensitive to differences in amplitude. Tests on synthetic and
real data show that the improved method not only has an increased
robustness with respect to the number of seeds and their locations, but
also provides a better fit of the observed data.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Carajás
Mineral Province (CMP), Brazil, by using two different 3D inversion methods.
Both inversion methods parameterized the Earth's subsurface into prismatic
cells and estimate the 3D density-contrast distribution that retrieves an
image of geologic sources subject to an acceptable data misfit. The first
inversion method imposes smoothness on the solution by solving a linear
system that minimizes an depth weighted L2 model objective function of
density-contrast distribution. The second imposes compactness on the solution
by using an iterative growth algorithm solved by a systematic search
algorithm that accretes mass around user-specified prisms called “seeds”.
Using these two inversion methods, the interpretation of full tensor gravity
gradiometry data from an iron ore deposit in the area named N1 at CMP shows
the consistent geometry and the depth of iron orebody. To date, the maximum
depth of the iron orebody is assumed to be 200 m based on the maximum depth
attained by the deepest well drilled in this study area. However, both
inversion results exhibit a source whose maximum bottom depth is greater than
200 m. These results give rise two interpretations: i) the iron orebody may
present its depth to the bottom greater than the maximum depth of 200 m
attained by the deepest borehole; or ii) the iron orebody may be 200 m deep
and the rocks below may be jaspilite whose density is close to that of soft
hematite.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The new observations of GOCE present a challenge to develop new calculation
methods that take into account the sphericity of the Earth. We address this
problem by using a discretization with a series of tesseroids. There is no
closed formula giving the gravitational fields of the tesseroid and
numerical integration methods must be used, such as the Gauss Legendre
Cubature (GLC). A problem that arises is that the computation times with
the tesseroids are high. Therefore, it is important to optimize the
computations while maintaining the desired accuracy. This optimization was
done using an adaptive computation scheme that consists of using a fixed
GLC order and recursively subdividing the tesseroids. We have obtained an
optimum ratio between the size of the tesseroid and its distance from the
computation point. Furthermore, we show that this size-to-distance ratio is
different for the gravitational attraction than for the gravity gradient
tensor.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a novel gravity inversion method for estimating a 3D
density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of prisms. Our method
consists of an iterative algorithm that does not require the solution of a
large equation system. Instead, the solution grows systematically around
user-specified prismatic elements called “seeds”. Each seed can have a
different density contrast, allowing the interpretation of multiple bodies
with different density contrasts and interfering gravitational effects. The
compactness of the solution around the seeds is imposed by means of a
regularizing function. The solution grows by the accretion of neighboring
prisms of the current solution. The prisms for the accretion are chosen by
systematically searching the set of current neighboring prisms. Therefore,
this approach allows that the columns of the Jacobian matrix be calculated
on demand. This is a known technique from computer science called “lazy
evaluation”, which greatly reduces the demand of computer memory and
processing time. Test on synthetic data and on real data collected over the
ultramafic Cana Brava complex, central Brazil, confirmed the ability of our
method in detecting sharp and compact bodies.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Quadrilátero
Ferrífero, an iron ore province in southeastern Brazil. Aiming at
retrieving the geometry of the iron body, we have used a fast and novel
gravity inversion method for estimating a 3D density‐contrast distribution
defined on a grid of prisms. This inversion approach combines robust
data‐fitting with an iterative procedure that does not require the solution
of a large equation system. By using a systematic search algorithm, the
estimated mass grows around prismatic elements called “seeds”. The
interpreter specifies the locations and the associated density contrasts of
the seeds. Automatically, the inversion method fits the observations and
favors compact gravity sources closest to the seeds. To produce a more
robust data fitting than least‐squares fit, the inversion method minimizes
the L1—norm of the residuals. Hence, it allows the presence of large
residuals, so that outliers produced by non‐targeted bodies can be handled.
By using 126 seeds which were assigned density contrasts of 0.5 g.cm−3 and
whose locations were based on our knowledge about the QF area, we have
retrieved a continuous elongated iron body that fits the observed
components of the gravity gradient. Our inversion result agrees reasonably
with previous geophysical interpretations. In addition, our result honors
the borehole information about the iron body depth.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
data download and processing to modeling and inversion. In this
opportunity we will present the two libraries that are focused on
potential fields: Harmonica and Boule. Boule implements reference
ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids, spheres, and soon triaxial
ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal and geocentric spherical
coordinates, and normal gravity calculations. The latter are performed
using analytical expressions for gravity fields at any point outside of
the ellipsoid. Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward
modelling, and inversion of gravity and magnetic data. We will
demonstrate its use to compute Bouguer gravity disturbances by forward
modelling the topography with prisms, removing a 2nd order regional
trend, and interpolating it onto a regular grid at a constant height
using the equivalent layer technique. Both libraries are still evolving
as we continue to refine their goals and scopes. We invite everyone to
get involved in the development, whether it's through coding, writing
documentation, or giving feedback.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is an invited presentation about the past, current, and future of
the Fatiando a Terra project. We will cover the current functionality,
recent developments, and lessons learned along the way.
The presentation is centered around a tutorial that walks you through the
steps of transforming observed absolute gravity measurements into a grid
of residual gravity disturbances at a constant height. The tutorial
showcases some of the core utilities of all of our open-source libraries.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Fatiando a Terra project (https://www.fatiando.org) was started in
2010 as a Python library for visualization, forward modelling, and
inversion across different geophysical methods. Over the following 8
years, the project attracted new contributors and grew to include
cutting-edge methods, toy examples for teaching, and helper functions for
visualization. Standards around testing, documentation, and code style
evolved and new tools appeared around the ecosystem (such as SimPEG,
PyVista, Devito, and pyGIMLi), making some of our functionality redundant
and outdated. In an attempt to better interface with the emerging
ecosystem, we started a major restructuring of the code base in 2018.
This presentation will cover the current available functionality and some
of the lessons learned from developing, growing, and maintaining the
project, including current challenges and our future plans.

establishing at the Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab for building
"repro-packs" for our papers and projects. We use a combination of
virtual environments, data download and caching tools, notebooks,
Makefiles, and data repositories to provide others with the means to
reproduce and build upon our work. We will also share some of the
unsolved challenges that we have encountered and our dreams for an ideal
workflow.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Scientific results are increasingly the product of software. The
reproducibility and validity of published results cannot be ensured
without access to the source code of the software used to produce them.
Therefore, the code itself is a fundamental part of the methodology and
must be published along with the results. With such a reliance on
software, it is troubling that most scientists do not receive formal
training in software development. Tools such as version control,
continuous integration, and automated testing are routinely used in
industry to ensure the correctness and robustness of software. However,
many scientist do not even know of their existence (although efforts like
Software Carpentry are having an impact on this issue). Publishing the
source code is only the first step in creating an open-source project.
For a project to grow it must provide documentation, participation
guidelines, and a welcoming environment for new contributors. Expanding
the project community is often more challenging than the technical
aspects of software development. Maintainers must invest time to enforce
the rules of the project and to onboard new members, which can be
difficult to justify in the context of the “publish or perish” mentality.
This problem will continue as long as software contributions are not
recognized as valid scholarship by hiring and tenure committees.
Furthermore, there are still unsolved problems in providing attribution
for software contributions. Many journals and metrics of academic
productivity do not recognize citations to sources other than traditional
publications. Thus, some authors choose to publish an article about the
software and use it as a citation marker. One issue with this approach is
that updating the reference to include new contributors involves writing
and publishing a new article. A better approach would be to cite a
permanent archive of individual versions of the source code in services
such as Zenodo. However, citations to these sources are not always
recognized when computing citation metrics. In summary, the widespread
development of reliable and robust open-source software relies on the
creation of formal training programs in software development best
practices and the recognition of software as a valid form of scholarship.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Os campos magnético e gravitacional da Terra nos fornecem uma janela para a
estrutura interna da crosta terrestre. Através dos pequenos distúrbios que
observamos nesses campos, somos capazes de inferir variações na densidade e
magnetização da crosta. Por sua vez, essas variações estão associadas a
bacias sedimentares, recursos minerais e geotermais, fluxo de calor,
espessura da crosta, entre outros. Nessa palestra, brevemente resumirei minha
trajetória na geofĩsica e no estudo do campo gravitacional e magnético da
Terra. Em seguida, irei descrever os temas de pesquisa que tenho abordado
recentemente utilizando dados do campo magnético: 1) em escala microscópica,
mesclando a geofĩsica aplicada com o paleomagnetismo através da microscopia
magnética; 2) em escala continental, aprimorando as formas de estimar o
fluxo de calor geotermal da Antárctica através de dados aeromagnéticos.

slides. This is a presentation about my path through geophysics and
open-source software, how it's shaped my research and teaching, what I see
as the future of this area (with some tips for informing yourself on
current software best practices), and some of the research we're doing at
the Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> I was really delighted to get an invitation to speak at my alma mater
(roughly 10 years after my graduation). The talk was also delivered
online. This was the first time delivering this talk in Portuguese, which
was a struggle since I had the words prepared in English already (slides
are still in English, though). I added the latest news of the successful
reproduction of the Ferguson COVID-19 modelling results. Funny enough,
this talk is heavily inspired on the last talk I gave there in 2015.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This was another online version of the talk. It was really nice to
connect with the geophysicists at Kiel since Prof. Jörg Ebbing's group
uses Tesseroids and was involved in the generation of the GOCE gravity
gradient grids cited in the talk. They have also used the Moho inversion
code and are getting involved in Fatiando. I added some bits to the end
about getting involved in open-source software projects and finding
online communities of practice (with a shout out to the Software
Underground).

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This is the second version of this talk and it was delivered online
because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I changed it a bit to reflect current
research presented at EGU2020 and focus less on the technical side of
development. The online delivery was new to me but it worked out well.
Even though it can be strange to talk to a screen for 50 minutes, the
great questions afterwards more than made up for it.

seminars. It was about my path through geophysics guided by my interests
in making open-source software: how I got started with coding, the various
projects I'm developing, how that's shaped my research, and plans for the
future.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> I gave this talk at the Earth Sciences Research Group (ESRG) seminar
series of the University of Liverpool. This was my first talk to the
department and I decided to layout why I think open-source development
boosts research productivity and what are the tools we use every day. I
hope to help people find these tools and lead by example in the
<a href="https://www.compgeolab.org">Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab</a>.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, I'll go over some of my work on open-source geophysics
software (Python and GMT), how we're building communities around them,
and how this ties into my current research and efforts towards
reproducibility.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> I gave this presentation at the TGIF Seminar series of the
<a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/index.html">Department of Earth
Sciences</a>, University of Hawaii at Manoa.
The topic merges my interest in machine learning, how we can borrow some
techniques for geophysical inversion, and the similarities with gridding
problems, like my work on GPS gridding.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine learning is the new trend sweeping across the Earth Sciences.
From the oil and gas industry to oceanography, these algorithms are being
trained to solve previously unsolvable (or extremely tedious) problems.
But what exactly is "machine learning" and what can be done with it? In
this talk, I will present a brief high-level overview of some of the core
concepts and interesting applications of machine learning methods to
geoscience data. I will also explore some of the best practices and
techniques that can be applied to geophysical inversion and interpolation
methods, including a new method for gridding 3-component GPS data.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> I gave this presentation at the
<a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/index.html">Department of Geology and Geophysics</a>
TGIF Seminar series shortly after arriving at the University of Hawaii
for my <a href="/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html">postdoc to work on GMT</a>.
The last interesting results that I'd had were from my PhD thesis so I
thought I'd present that, though heavily edited in the interest of time.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The inner density distribution of the Earth can be inferred from
disturbances in its gravitational field. However, accomplishing this is
never easy. There are many possible parameterizations for the
mathematical model, which is often non-linear. To make matters worse,
gravity data alone do not contain enough information to obtain a unique
and stable solution. One must add independent information to constrain
the solution space, often in the form of regularization. Many different
methods for performing this inference have been developed and research in
this field is still active. Investigating new methodologies implies
developing complex software, which often must be able to deal with sparse
matrices and parallelism. I’ll present the open-source Python library
Fatiando a Terra. It implements many of the components required for
developing inversion methods, such as forward modeling, data processing
and I/O, and regularization. I’ll also show how I used this library to
develop a computationally efficient method for estimating the Moho depth
from gravity data using a spherical approximation of the Earth.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is a presentation I gave for the Department of Geophysics of the
University of São Paulo and also at the Observatório Nacional. It's about
my open-source project Fatiando a Terra and how I'm using for teaching
geophysics and doing my own research on inverse problems. It was also my
first invited talk and it was an honor to be back at my alma mater as a
professor instead of a student.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> O Fatiando a Terra é uma biblioteca feita na linguagem Python que tem
como objetivo facilitar o trabalho de pesquisadores e professores na área
geofísica. Os módulos da biblioteca foram planejados para facilitar a
combinação de seus componentes de diversas formas. Por exemplo, o mesmo
módulo de modelagem direta pode ser usado para produzir dados sintéticos,
desenvolver um método de inversão ou como parte de uma interface gráfica
interativa. Além disso, as funções da biblioteca podem ser combinadas com
funções desenvolvidas pelo usuário e com as muitas bibliotecas
científicas da linguagem Python. O módulo de problemas inversos
automatiza grande parte da implementação de um novo método de inversão. O
pesquisador implementa somente o cálculo de dados preditos e da matriz de
sensibilidade, ambos reutilizando os diversos módulos de modelagem
direta. Com essas duas funções, o usuário pode escolher livremente entre
diversos métodos de optimização e regularização para executar sua
inversão.
Para o ensino de geofísica, a biblioteca pode ser combinada com a
interatividade de outros programas, particularmente o IPython notebook
(www.ipython.org). Conceitos difíceis de serem transmitidos em aula podem
ser explorados pelos alunos de forma interativa, com botões, gráficos e
animações. Por exemplo, para ensinar a reflexão e refração de ondas
sísmicas, o professor pode utilizar simulações numéricas da propagação de
ondas para produzir animações em tempo real. Outro exemplo é permitir aos
alunos explorar como o campo geomagnético interage com um corpo geológico
a diferentes latitudes para produzir uma anomalia magnética de campo
total. Dessa forma, os alunos ganham experiência e intuição ao interagir
com os resultados.
A implementação de diversos métodos geofísicos em uma única biblioteca
fornece a base necessária para a rápida criação de novas metodologias e
material didático interativo. A maior parte da funcionalidade atual é
para gravimetria e magnetometria, embora já exista um núcleo de sísmica e
sismologia que está sendo desenvolvido. O projeto necessita de usuários e
desenvolvedores para crescer e abranger os demais ramos da geofísica. O
projeto é software livre e contribuições de qualquer forma são bem
vindas.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gravimetry is a routine part of the geophysicists toolset, historically
used in geophysics following the geodetic definitions of gravity
anomalies and their related “reductions”. Several authors have shown that
the geodetic concept of a gravity anomaly does not align with goals of
gravimetry in geophysics (the investigation of anomalous density
distributions). Much of this confusion likely stems from the lack of
widely available tools for performing the corrections needed to arrive at
a geophysically meaningful gravity disturbance. For example, free-air
corrections are completely unnecessary since analytical expressions for
theoretical gravity at any point have existed for over a decade. Since
this is not easily done in a spreadsheet or short script, modern tools
for processing and modelling gravity data for geophysics are needed.
These tools must be trustworthy (i.e., extensively tested) and designed
with software development and geophysical best practices in mind.
We present the Python libraries Harmonica and Boule, which are part of
the <a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a> project. Both
tools are open-source under the permissive BSD license and are developed
in the open by a community of geoscientists and programmers.
Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward modelling, and inversion
of gravity and magnetic data. The first release of Harmonica was focused
on implementing methods for processing and interpolation with the
equivalent source technique, as well as forward modelling with
right-rectangular prisms, point sources, and tesseroids. Current work is
directed towards implementing a processing pipeline for gravity data,
including topographic corrections in Cartesian and spherical coordinates,
atmospheric corrections, and more. The software is still in early stages
of development and design and would benefit greatly from community
involvement and feedback.
Boule implements reference ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids,
spheres, and soon triaxial ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal
and geocentric spherical coordinates, and normal gravity calculations
using analytical solutions for gravity fields at any point outside of the
ellipsoid. It includes ellipsoids for the Earth as well as other
planetary bodies in the solar system, like Mars, the Moon, Venus, and
Mercury. This enables the calculation of gravity disturbances for Earth
and planetary data without the need for free-air corrections. Boule was
created out of the shared needs of Harmonica,
<a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS">SHTools</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/ioshchepkov/pygeoid">pygeoid</a> and is
developed with input from developers of these projects.
We welcome participation from the wider geophysical community,
irrespective of programming skill level and experience, and are actively
searching for interested developers and users to get involved in shaping
the future of these projects.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> Presented at EGU 2020 (online because of COVID-19), session
<a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/session/35332">G4.3:
Acquisition and processing of gravity and magnetic field data and their integrative interpretation</a>.
Details some of the work we've been doing in <a href="https://www.fatiando.org/verde">Verde</a> and
<a href="https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica">Harmonica</a> for machine-learning style
interpolation with equivalent-sources.
In particular, applying state-of-the-art cross-validation strategies to
estimate interpolation accuracy and tune equivalent-source parameters.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigate the use of cross-validation (CV) techniques to estimate
the accuracy of equivalent-source (also known as equivalent-layer) models
for interpolation and processing of potential-field data. Our preliminary
results indicate that some common CV algorithms (e.g., random
permutations and k-folds) tend to overestimate the accuracy. We have
found that blocked CV methods, where the data are split along spatial
blocks instead of randomly, provide more conservative and realistic
accuracy estimates. Beyond evaluating an equivalent-source model's
performance, cross-validation can be used to automatically determine
configuration parameters, like source depth and amount of regularization,
that maximize prediction accuracy and avoid over-fitting.
Widely used in gravity and magnetic data processing, the
equivalent-source technique consists of a linear model (usually point
sources) used to predict the observed field at arbitrary locations.
Upward-continuation, interpolation, gradient calculations, leveling, and
reduction-to-the-pole can be performed simultaneously by using the model
to make predictions (i.e., forward modelling). Likewise, the use of
linear models to make predictions is the backbone of many machine
learning (ML) applications. The predictive performance of ML models is
usually evaluated through cross-validation, in which the data are split
(usually randomly) into a training set and a validation set. Models are
fit on the training set and their predictions are evaluated using the
validation set using a goodness-of-fit metric, like the mean square error
or the R² coefficient of determination. Many cross-validation methods
exist in the literature, varying in how the data are split and how this
process is repeated. Prior research from the statistical modelling of
ecological data suggests that prediction accuracy is usually
overestimated by traditional CV methods when the data are spatially
auto-correlated. This issue can be mitigated by splitting the data along
spatial blocks rather than randomly. We conducted experiments on
synthetic gravity data to investigate the use of traditional and blocked
CV methods in equivalent-source interpolation. We found that the
overestimation problem also occurs and that more conservative accuracy
estimates are obtained when applying blocked versions of random
permutations and k-fold. Further studies need to be conducted to
generalize these findings to upward-continuation, reduction-to-the-pole,
and derivative calculation.
Open-source software implementations of the equivalent-source and blocked
cross-validation (in progress) methods are available in the Python
libraries Harmonica and Verde, which are part of the Fatiando a Terra
project.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is an update on the progress we've made in
<a href="https://www.pygmt.org">PyGMT</a>.
There are examples of some of the new features implemented by myself and
contributors, as well as the main problems we're facing and a call for
volunteers.
The main feedback we got during the meeting is that the API is not very
intuitive for people unfamiliar with GMT (which I expect to be the
majority of users). This has got me thinking of ways to move away from
the direct mapping of GMT modules to PyGMT functions. Instead, we should
implement something that makes sense in Python and call whatever GMT
modules we need to get that done under the hood.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> For almost 30 years, the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) have provided the
Earth, Ocean, and Planetary Sciences with an open-source toolbox for
processing and visualizing spatial data (bathymetry, gravity, magnetic,
earthquake focal mechanisms, and more). In many fields, GMT is the de
facto standard for creating high-resolution publication quality maps,
figures, and animations. Since version 5, GMT has provided a C language
Application Programming Interface (API) that allows other programs to
access its core functionality. We are using this bridge to develop
<a href="https://www.pygmt.org">PyGMT</a>
(formerly GMT/Python), an open-source library that allows
users of the Python programming language to leverage the almost thirty
years of continuous GMT development. PyGMT is designed to integrate with
the existing scientific Python ecosystem, including popular packages such
as numpy, pandas, and xarray. PyGMT integrates seamlessly with the
Jupyter notebook, allowing high-quality figures to be generated
interactively both in a personal computer and in cloud computing
environments compatible with Jupyter. We will present the design and
usage of the software package, latest developments and updates, and
lessons learned during its implementation.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is update on my GPS interpolation work (see the AOGS2018 presentation).
The implementation is entirely based on the
<a href="https://www.fatiando.org/verde">Verde library</a> (there is an
<a href="/blog/introducing-verde.html">introduction to what it can do on
the blog</a>). This was the first test of the Verde API and I'm glad to
say that it passed with flying colors. Implementing the new methods was
very straight forward and all the tools in Verde made the entire data
processing and model selection pipeline simple and easy.

          <img src="../images/agu2018.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the poster">
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> GPS/GNSS measurements of deformation have high accuracy and temporal
resolution but are spatially sparse. Conversely, InSAR provides great
spatial resolution but is limited by the satellite look angle,
atmospheric noise, and the delay between repeat passes. The sparse GPS
data often need to be interpolated on regular grids to be used as
constraints during InSAR processing or to calculate strain rates. The
interpolation is routinely done separately for each component of the
velocity field using minimum curvature or specialized geostatistical
algorithms. Recently, a joint interpolation of the horizontal components
has been proposed. It estimates forces on a thin elastic sheet that fit
the observed data and subsequently uses the estimated model to predict
data on regular grids or arbitrary points. The Green’s functions for the
physical model serve as a coupling between the two vector components
through elasticity theory. We propose an extension of this method to 3D,
using the elastic Green’s functions to couple the horizontal and vertical
components. This enables the inclusion of vector data projected in
arbitrary directions, such as InSAR line-of-sight velocities. The degree
of coupling can be controlled through the Poisson’s ratio of the medium.
We apply damping regularization to smooth the model and avoid
instabilities in the inverse problem. Furthermore, we automatically
select optimal values for the Poisson’s ratio and regularization
parameter through cross-validation, which is common in machine learning
applications. We compare the performance of the coupled model with
uncoupled alternatives to grid 2- and 3-component GPS velocities and
calculate derivatives through finite-differences approximations. We will
present preliminary results from applications to GPS data from the
Himalayas and the calibration of InSAR data products. A future goal is to
integrate InSAR line-of-sight velocities in a joint interpolation with
GPS velocities.

<a href="https://www.pygmt.org">GMT/Python</a>, a wrapper that
<a href="/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html">I'm building for the Generic

It showed the progress that we made in the past year, what our struggles
and successes were, and our plans for the future.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We are building a Python wrapper for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), a
set of command-line programs used across the Earth, Atmospheric, and
Ocean Sciences to process and visualize geographic data. At SciPy 2017,
we presented the project goals and an initial prototype. The feedback
received led to improvements in the design of the library, mainly the
creation of an object-oriented API. We will present the newest
developments including support for numpy arrays and pandas Dataframes,
interactive visualization in the Jupyter notebook using NASA WorldWind,
and more. Once again, we seek feedback from the community to guide us
moving forward.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This talk is about some early results from a collaboration me and Paul
have with <a href="http://topex.ucsd.edu/sandwell/">David Sandwell</a>.
The project was started by Paul and Dave as a follow up to their
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL070340">2016 paper about
interpolating 2D vector data</a>.
We're expanding it into 3D and ironing out some kinks in the methodology.
I picked it up at the beginning of the year and have been slowly trying
things out. It was a great chance to play with some tools from machine
learning since this is a supervised prediction problem. Unlike most
geophysical inversion, we're not really interested in the estimated
parameters themselves. They are only a means to predict new values (on a
regular grid in the case of gridding). I started implementing the tools I
would need in a Python library called
<a href="https://github.com/fatiando/verde">Verde</a>, which served as
the basis for the results shown in the presentation.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Vertical ground motion at fault systems can be difficult to detect due to
their small amplitude and contamination from non-tectonic sources, such
as ground water loading. However, it may play an important role in our
understanding of the earthquake cycle and the associated seismic hazards.
Ground motion measurements from GPS are often sparse and must be
interpolated onto a regular grid (e.g., for computing strain rate),
ideally taking into account the varying degrees of uncertainty of the
data. Traditionally, each vector component is interpolated separately
using minimum curvature or biharmonic spline methods. Recently, a joint
interpolation of the two horizontal components has been developed using
the Green's functions for a point force deforming a thin elastic sheet.
The elasticity constraints provide a coupling between the two vector
components and lead to improved results because the underlying physics of
the method approximately matches that of the GPS observations. We propose
an expansion of this method into 3D in order to incorporate vertical GPS
velocity measurements. To smooth the model and avoid singularities, we
formulate the interpolation as a weighted least-squares inverse problem
with damping regularization. Optimal values of the regularization
parameter and the Poisson's ratio of the elastic medium are determined
through K-fold cross-validation, a technique often used in machine
learning for model selection. Additionally, the cross-validation provides
a measure of the accuracy of model predictions and eliminates the need
for manual configuration. The computational load of the inversion is
lessened by imposing a cutoff distance to the Green's functions
computations, which makes the sensitivity matrix sparse. We will present
preliminary results from an application to EarthScope GPS data from the
San Andreas Fault system. In the future, we aim to develop a joint
inversion of 3D GPS and InSAR line-of-sight velocities to improve data
coverage.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is the third presentation I gave about my work on
<a href="http://www.pygmt.org/">GMT/Python</a>. This is by far the nicest
poster I have ever designed.
It showcases the new support for <code>gmt.Figure.grdimage</code>, the
built-in Earth relief datasets in GMT6, and plotting vectors with
<code>gmt.Figure.plot</code>. I wanted to have a more sophisticated
showcase of <code>grdimage</code> but I ran into some bugs before the
conference and wasn't able to finish it in time. Still, I'm amazed at how
few lines of code are required to make the figure in the poster. The more
I get to know GMT, the more I'm impressed by how much thought and
attention was, and still is, poured into it.

          <img src="../images/aogs2018.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the poster">
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are used throughout the geosciences to
processes spatial data and create publication quality data
visualizations, such as contour maps, earthquake focal mechanism
solutions, and animations. The software is programmed in the C language
and is accessed through a command-line interface. Recent versions of GMT
also provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows
access to the core functionality from other programming languages,
potentially expanding the reach of GMT far beyond the current user base.
A GMT toolbox for Matlab using the API has already been released, and an
experimental interface from the Julia language is being developed. We are
building a software library to interface GMT with the Python programming
language. Popularity of Python has grown steadily in the Earth Sciences
due to its simplicity and powerful set of scientific libraries. However,
there is still great need for the geospatial processing and mapping
capabilities of GMT. The GMT/Python library integrates with the
scientific Python ecosystem through the support of common Python data
types: numpy "ndarrays" and Pandas "DataFrames" for tabular data and
xarray "Datasets" for grids. We have also implemented support for the
Jupyter notebooks, a web-based interactive computing environment. These
features will help make GMT more accessible to students and professional
geoscientists who lack an extensive background in Unix tools and shell
scripting. GMT/Python is an open-source project in early stages of
development. The current focus is on the implementation of a robust set
of core routines that implement the bridge between Python and GMT. Later,
we will expand the library to cover the entire functionality of GMT. A
first release is predicted for the late 2018. The latest documentation
and source code can be accessed through the website
<a href="http://www.pygmt.org/">www.pygmt.org</a>.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is the second conference presentation about my work on GMT/Python.
The first was my talk at SciPy 2017. I mostly made progress establishing
the basis for the software: documentation build, CIs, and the code to
talk to the C API. I hadn't presented a poster in 3 years and I really
enjoyed designing this one. The background image was generated using
GMT/Python (see the code in the poster). It's a clean design and I like
how it turned out.
</p>
          <img src="../images/agu2017.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the poster">
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Figures generated by The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are present in
countless publications across the Earth sciences. The command-line
interface of GMT lends the tool its flexibility but also creates a
barrier to entry for beginners. Meanwhile, adoption of the Python
programming language has grown across the scientific community. This
growth is largely due to the simplicity and low barrier to entry of the
language and its ecosystem of tools. Thus, it is not surprising that
there have been at least three attempts to create Python interfaces for
GMT: gmtpy, pygmt, and PyGMT. None of these projects are currently active
and, with the exception of pygmt, they do not use the GMT Application
Programming Interface (API) introduced in GMT 5.  The two main Python
libraries for plotting data on maps are the matplotlib Basemap toolkit
(matplotlib.org/basemap) and Cartopy (scitools.org.uk/cartopy), both of
which rely on matplotlib (matplotlib.org) as the backend for generating
the figures. Basemap is known to have limitations and is being
discontinued.  Cartopy is an improvement over Basemap but is still bound
by the speed and memory constraints of matplotlib. We present a new
Python interface for GMT (GMT/Python) that makes use of the GMT API and
of new features being developed for the upcoming GMT 6 release. The
GMT/Python library is designed according to the norms and styles of the
Python community. The library integrates with the scientific Python
ecosystem by using the “virtual files” from the GMT API to implement
input and output of Python data types (numpy “ndarray” for tabular data
and xarray “Dataset” for grids). Other features include an
object-oriented interface for creating figures, the ability to display
figures in the Jupyter notebook, and descriptive aliases for GMT
arguments (e.g., “region” instead of “R” and “projection” instead of
“J”). GMT/Python can also serve as a backend for developing new
high-level interfaces, which can help make GMT more accessible to
beginners and more intuitive for Python users. GMT/Python is an
open-source project hosted on GitHub and is in early stages of
development. A first release will accompany the release of  GMT 6, which
is expected for early 2018.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This was the first talk I gave about GMT/Python, a wrapper that
<a href="/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html" >I'm building for the Generic
Mapping Tools</a>. I didn't have that much implemented yet but was able
to give a quick demo.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is an open-source software package widely
used in the geosciences to process and visualize time series and gridded
data. Maps generated by GMT are ubiquitous in scientific publications in
areas such as seismology and oceanography. We present a new GMT Python
wrapper library built by the GMT team. We will show the design plans,
internal implementations, and demonstrate an initial prototype of the
library. Our wrapper connects to the GMT C API using ctypes and allows
input and output using data from numpy ndarrays and xarray Datasets. The
library is still in early stages of design and implementation and we are
eager for contributions and feedback from the SciPy community.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Satellite observations of the gravity field have provided geophysicists
with exceptionally dense and uniform coverage of data over vast areas.
This enables regional or global scale high resolution geophysical
investigations. Techniques like forward modeling and inversion of gravity
anomalies are routinely used to investigate large geologic structures,
such as large igneous provinces, suture zones, intracratonic basins, and
the Moho. Accurately modeling such large structures requires taking the
sphericity of the Earth into account. A reasonable approximation is to
assume a spherical Earth and use spherical coordinates.
In recent years, efforts have been made to advance forward modeling in
spherical coordinates using tesseroids, particularly with respect to
speed and accuracy. Conversely, traditional space domain inverse modeling
methods have not yet been adapted to use spherical coordinates and
tesseroids. In the literature there are a range of inversion methods that
have been developed for Cartesian coordinates and right rectangular
prisms. These include methods for estimating the relief of an interface,
like the Moho or the basement of a sedimentary basin. Another category
includes methods to estimate the density distribution in a medium. The
latter apply many algorithms to solve the inverse problem, ranging from
analytic solutions to random search methods as well as systematic search
methods.
We present an adaptation for tesseroids of the systematic search method
of "planting anomalous densities". This method can be used to estimate
the geometry of geologic structures. As prior information, it requires
knowledge of the approximate densities and positions of the structures.
The main advantage of this method is its computational efficiency,
requiring little computer memory and processing time. We demonstrate the
shortcomings and capabilities of this approach using applications to
synthetic and field data. Performing the inversion of gravity and gravity
gradient data, simultaneously or separately, is straight forward and
requires no changes to the existing algorithm. Such feature makes it
ideal for inverting the multicomponent gravity gradient data from the
GOCE satellite.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This was the first presentation that I made about Fatiando a Terra, a
Python library for modeling and inversion in geophysics. The proceedings
paper that accompanies this talk became the second chapter of my PhD
thesis.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Solid Earth geophysics is the science of using physical observations of
the Earth to infer its inner structure. Generally, this is done with a
variety of numerical modeling techniques and inverse problems. The
development of new algorithms usually involves copy and pasting of code,
which leads to errors and poor code reuse. Added to this is a modeling
pipeline composed of various tools that don't communicate with each other
(Fortran/C for computations, large complicated I/O files, Matlab/VTK for
visualization, etc). Fatiando a Terra is a Python library that aims to
unify the modeling pipeline inside of the Python language. This allows
users to replace the traditional shell scripting with more versatile and
powerful Python scripting. Together with the new IPython notebook,
Fatiando a Terra can integrate all stages of the geophysical modeling
process, like data pre-processing, inversion, statistical analysis, and
visualization. However, the library can also be used for quickly
developing stand-alone programs that can be integrated into existing
pipelines. Plus, because functions inside Fatiando a Terra use a common
data and mesh format, existing algorithms can be combined and new ideas
can build upon existing functionality. This flexibility facilitates
reproducible computations, prototyping of new algorithms, and interactive
teaching exercises. Although the project has so far focused on potential
field methods (gravity and magnetics), some numerical tools for other
geophysical methods have been developed as well. The library already
contains: fast implementations of forward modeling algorithms (using
Numpy and Cython), generic inverse problem solvers, unified geometry
classes (prism meshes, polygons, etc), functions to automate repetitive
plotting tasks with Matplotlib (automatic griding, simple GUIs, picking,
projections, etc) and Mayavi (automatic conversion of geometry classes to
VTK, drawing continents, etc). In the future, we plan to continuously
implement classic and state-of-the-art algorithms as well as sample
problems to help teach geophysics.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> As you may have noticed, there is an error in the title. We do not, in
fact, invert magnetic data using density anomalies. This illustrates the
perils of copy-pasting combined with a looming deadline.
This talk presents an adaptation of the gravity-gradient inversion method
I developed for my Masters degree dissertation "Robust 3D gravity
gradient inversion by planting anomalous densities" to invert magnetic
data.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a new 3D magnetic inversion algorithm based on the
computationally efficient method of planting anomalous densities. The
algorithm consists of an iterative growth of the anomalous bodies around
prismatic elements called "seeds". These seeds are user-specified and
have known magnetizations. Thus, the seeds provide a way for the
interpreter to specify the desired skeleton of the anomalous bodies. The
inversion algorithm is computationally efficient due to various
optimizations made possible by the iterative nature of the growth
process. The control provided by the use of seeds allows one to test
different hypothesis about the geometry and magnetization of targeted
anomalous bodies. To demonstrate this capability, we applied our
inversion method to the Morro do Engenho (ME) and A2 magnetic anomalies,
central Brazil (Figure 1a). ME is an outcropping alkaline intrusion
formed by dunites, peridotites and pyroxenites with known magnetization.
A2 is a magnetic anomaly to the Northeast of ME and is thought to be a
similar intrusion that is not outcropping. Therefore, a plausible
hypothesis is that A2 has the same magnetization as ME. We tested this
hypothesis by performing an inversion using a single seed for each body.
Both seeds had the same magnetization. Figure 1b shows that the inversion
produced residuals up to 2000 nT over A2 (i.e., a poor fit) and less than
400 nT over ME (i.e., an acceptable fit). Figure 1c shows that ME is a
compact outcropping body with bottom at approximately 5 km, which is in
agreement with previous interpretations. However, the estimate produced
by the inversion for A2 is outcropping and is not compact. In summary,
the estimate for A2 provides a poor fit to the observations and is not in
accordance with the geologic information. This leads to the conclusion
that A2 does not have the same magnetization as ME. These results
indicate the usefulness and capabilities of the inversion method here
proposed.

the talk on his behalf.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Carajás
Mineral Province (CMP), Brazil, by using two different 3D inversion
methods. Both inversion methods parameterized the Earth's subsurface into
prismatic cells and estimate the 3D density-contrast distribution that
retrieves an image of geologic sources subject to an acceptable data
misfit. The first inversion method imposes smoothness on the solution by
solving a linear system that minimizes an depth weighted L2 model
objective function of density-contrast distribution. The second imposes
compactness on the solution by using an iterative growth algorithm solved
by a systematic search algorithm that accretes mass around user-specified
prisms called “seeds”. Using these two inversion methods, the
interpretation of full tensor gravity gradiometry data from an iron ore
deposit in the area named N1 at CMP shows the consistent geometry and the
depth of iron orebody. To date, the maximum depth of the iron orebody is
assumed to be 200 m based on the maximum depth attained by the deepest
well drilled in this study area. However, both inversion results exhibit
a source whose maximum bottom depth is greater than 200 m. These
results give rise two interpretations: i) the iron orebody may present
its depth to the bottom greater than the maximum depth of 200 m attained
by the deepest borehole; or ii) the iron orebody may be 200 m deep and
the rocks below may be jaspilite whose density is close to that of soft
hematite.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This talk is about an improvement to the method described in the paper
"Robust 3D gravity gradient inversion by planting anomalous densities".
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present an improvement to the method of 3D gravity gradient inversion
by planting anomalous densities. This method estimates a density-contrast
distribution defined on a grid of right-rectangular prisms. Instead of
solving large equation systems, the method uses a systematic search
algorithm to grow the solution, one prism at a time, around
user-specified prisms called "seeds". These seeds have known density
contrasts and the solution is constrained to be concentrated around the
seeds as well as have their density contrasts. Thus, prior geologic and
geophysical information are incorporated into the inverse problem through
the seeds. However, this leads to a strong dependence of the solution on
the correct location, density contrast, and number of seeds used. Our
improvement to this method consists of using the "shape-of-anomaly"
data-misfit function in conjunction with the l2-norm data-misfit
function. The shape-of-anomaly function measures the different in shape
between the observed and predicted data and is insensitive to differences
in amplitude. Tests on synthetic and real data show that the improved
method not only has an increased robustness with respect to the number of
seeds and their locations, but also provides a better fit of the observed
data.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Forward modeling of potential fields is a useful way to incorporate the
interpreter's knowledge about the geology of the interpretation area into
the model. However, this can be a very tedious task. This is specially
true when modeling in 3D and trying to fit multiple components, e.g., in
gravity gradiometry. The interpreter is required to simultaneously
supervise the data fit and the construction of geologically realistic 3D
bodies. This problem is partially solved by methods of geophysical
inversion, which automatically fit the data. Conversely, inverse problems
introduce other challenges of their own. Most geophysical inverse
problems are ill-posed because their solutions are neither unique nor
stable. Thus, they require the introduction of prior information, usually
through regularizing functions. Moreover, 3D inverse problems are very
computationally expensive. Recent developments in potential field
inversion have proposed different regularizing functions to transform the
ill-posed problem into a well-posed one. Also, several techniques, like
data compression and parallel computation, have been applied to overcome
the computational complexity. We call attention to the method of
potential field inversion by planting anomalous densities. This method
uses an iterative algorithm to automatically grow the anomalous bodies
around user-specified prismatic elements called "seeds", which have fixed
density contrasts and positions. These seeds provide a first estimate of
the skeletal outlines of the presumed anomalous bodies. Then, the
inversion iteratively concentrates mass around this "skeleton" in a way
that both fits the observed data and yields compact bodies. Therefore,
the interpreter can easily impose prior information on the inversion
through the seeds. The interpreter needs only to supply a few seeds that
specify the sources' skeleton, eliminating the exhaustive task of
specifying the complete geometry of multiple sources. Moreover, the
interpreter is liberated from the time- consuming procedure of yielding a
reasonable fit to the data. Due to its high computational efficiency, the
method of planting anomalous densities can be used to quickly test
geologic hypothesis of different locations and density contrasts for
presumed sources. To test a hypothesis, one would choose the locations
and density contrasts of the seeds accordingly and verify if the
inversion result is able to fit the observed data. If it is not able,
then the hypothesis can be rejected and a new one can be formulated and
tested. Otherwise, there is no reason to reject the hypothesis on the
basis of the geophysical data. Thus, the method can be viewed as a an
enhanced forward modeling. The method of planting anomalous densities can
be used with both gravity and gravity gradient data. This makes it an
ideal tool to interpret compact geologic bodies using the new generation
GOCE data. We present applications to synthetic and real data that
illustrate the usefulness of our method.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a new gravity gradient inversion method for estimating a 3D
density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of prisms. Our method
consists of an iterative algorithm that does not require the solution of
a large equation system. Instead, the solution grows systematically
around user-specified prismatic elements called "seeds". Each seed can be
assigned a different density contrast, allowing the interpretation of
multiple bodies with different density contrasts and that produce
interfering gravitational effects. The compactness of the solution around
the seeds is imposed by means of a regularizing function. The solution
grows by the accretion of neighboring prisms of the current solution. The
prisms for the accretion are chosen by systematically searching the set
of current neighboring prisms. Therefore, this approach allows that the
columns of the Jacobian matrix be calculated on demand, which greatly
reduces the demand of computer memory and processing time. Tests on
synthetic data and on real data collected over an iron ore province of
Quadrilátero Ferrífero, southeastern Brazil, confirmed the ability of our
method in detecting sharp and compact bodies.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This poster and conference proceedings present the results and methods
after the 1.0 release of Tesseroids. Version 1.0 was a complete re-write
of the original Python code in the C language. This work was made
possible by professor Carla Braitenberg. She funded me to spend a month
at the University of Trieste, Italy, and re-write the software from
scratch. What followed was a much faster and more robust
program.
This version also featured the first iteration of the adaptive
discretization presented in the paper "Tesseroids: forward modeling
gravitational fields in spherical coordinates" and my PhD thesis.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The new observations of GOCE present a challenge to develop new
calculation methods that take into account the sphericity of the Earth.
We address this problem by using a discretization with a series of
tesseroids. There is no closed formula giving the gravitational fields of
the tesseroid and numerical integration methods must be used, such as the
Gauss Legendre Cubature (GLC). A problem that arises is that the
computation times with the tesseroids are high. Therefore, it is
important to optimize the computations while maintaining the desired
accuracy. This optimization was done using an adaptive computation scheme
that consists of using a fixed GLC order and recursively subdividing the
tesseroids. We have obtained an optimum ratio between the size of the
tesseroid and its distance from the computation point. Furthermore, we
show that this size-to-distance ratio is different for the gravitational
attraction than for the gravity gradient tensor.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is a presentation of the methods behind the open-source software
Tesseroids. The algorithms implemented in the software have since been
updated (see the paper "Tesseroids: forward modeling gravitational fields
in spherical coordinates") and have become a part of my PhD thesis. The
content of this presentation is a summary of my Bachelor's degree thesis.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The GOCE satellite mission has the objective of measuring the Earth's
gravitational field with an unprecedented accuracy through the
measurement of the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). One of the several
applications of this new gravity data set is to study the geodynamics of
the lithospheric plates, where the flat Earth approximation may not be
ideal and the Earth's curvature should be taken into account. In such a
case, the Earth could be modeled using tesseroids, also called spherical
prisms, instead of the conventional rectangular prisms. The GGT due to a
tesseroid is calculated using numerical integration methods, such as the
Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ), as already proposed by Asgharzadeh et
al. (2007) and Wild-Pfeiffer (2008). We present a computer program for
the direct computation of the GGT caused by a tesseroid using the GLQ.
The accuracy of this implementation was evaluated by comparing its
results with the result of analytical formulas for the special case of a
spherical cap with computation point located at one of the poles. The GGT
due to the topographic masses of the Parana basin (SE Brazil) was
estimated at 260km altitude in an attempt to quantify this effect on the
GOCE gravity data. The digital elevation model ETOPO1 (Amante and Eakins,
2009) between 40º W and 65º W and 10º S and 35º S, which includes the
Paraná Basin, was used to generate a tesseroid model of the topography
with grid spacing of 10' x 10' and a constant density of 2670 kg/m3. The
largest amplitude observed was on the second vertical derivative
component (-0.05 to 1.20 Eötvos) in regions of rough topography, such as
that along the eastern Brazilian continental margins. These results
indicate that the GGT due to topographic masses may have amplitudes of
the same order of magnitude as the GGT due to density anomalies within
the crust and mantle.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A ESA (European Space Agency) planeja lançar no outono de 2008 a missão
GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer). A
missão foi planejada para medir o campo gravitacional da Terra com
acurácia e resolução sem precedentes. Para isso, fará uso de um
gradiômetro de gravidade eletrostático que consiste de três pares de
acelerômetros idênticos mutuamente ortogonais. O GOCE fornecerá dados do
tensor gradiente da gravidade (TGG) a uma altitude de órbita de
aproximadamente 250 km.
Está sendo desenvolvido um programa computacional para analisar dados do
TGG sobre as bacias sedimentares brasileiras. O programa utilizará o
método da Quadratura Gauss-Legendre para efetuar a modelagem direta do
TGG gerado por feições ou corpos geológicos com geometria esférica. A
modelagem será feita discretizando o corpo por tesseróides, também
denominados prismas esféricos. Os tesseróides são segmentos de uma casca
esférica de espessura finita limitados por linhas de grade geográficas. A
geometria dos tesseróides possibilita a construção de modelos levando em
conta a curvatura da Terra. Isto se torna importante na modelagem de
corpos geológicos com grande extensão lateral, como por exemplo, a bacia
do Paraná. Será criado um modelo de densidade desta bacia a partir de
dados de poços e dados sísmicos e utilizaremos o programa desenvolvido
para obter estimativas do TGG. As estimativas serão comparadas com os
futuros dados do GOCE na tentativa de separar o componente gravimétrico
associado às variações de densidade na parte mais profunda da bacia.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Towards the construction of a new magnetic map of Antarctica, we investigate the use of gradient-boosted equivalent sources to model data from aeromagnetic surveys. Airborne surveys have larger spacing between adjacent lines compared with along-line spacing. By using the equivalent source technique, gravity and magnetic data can be interpolated onto a regular grid at constant height. This method is particularly useful to prepare the data for further use, such as modelling crustal structures and geological interpretation. The equivalent source technique uses a finite layer of sources to generate the same field as the observed data. These sources are then used to predict the field in unobserved locations. However, estimating the source coefficients that best fit the observed data is computationally demanding. To overcome this problem, the source coefficients are estimated in overlapping windows and carried out iteratively, similar to the gradient boosting method used in machine learning. At each iteration, the sources are fit to the field residuals from the previous iteration. Here we apply the gradient-boosted equivalent sources method to interpolate total-field anomaly observations and convert them to the norm of the anomalous field. We use two layers of equivalent sources at different depths to fit both the regional field and the field due to the shallower sources. We demonstrate using synthetic surveys and an Antarctic magnetic dataset that our dual-layer gradient-boosted equivalent sources are able to produce grids of both the total-field anomaly and the norm of the anomalous field accurately and with a low computational cost.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Geophysical inversions are essential for interpreting geological structures through indirect observations, like potential field data. The planting method is a computationally efficient inversion algorithm that grows a solution iteratively from “seed” elements within a discretized 3D mesh of rectangular prisms. The original software implementation has been updated and the method has been expanded to include a new mesh refinement strategy. Current results demonstrate that the mesh refinement is successful at recovering complex geometries from a single starting seed. The influence of mesh size on the inversion accuracy and the calibration of critical parameters (e.g., regularization and normalization factors) require further investigation

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Paleomagnetism relies on magnetic signals preserved in minerals to reconstruct Earth’s geodynamic history, yet traditional techniques average magnetization across bulk rock samples. Magnetic microscopy ennables measurement of magnetic fields from individual mineral grains. To fully exploit this potential, new computational tools are needed to process the massive datasets generated by this technique. This project introduces Magali, an open-source Python software designed to handle and interpret magnetic microscopy data with a focus on paleomagnetic applications. Magali will implement state-of-the-art methods, including automatic dipole inversion based on Euler deconvolution and dipolar modeling, as well as QDM-specific processing tools. Developed under the Fatiando a Terra project, Magali will be released with thorough documentation and community-focused outreach to support adoption and collaborative development. By providing robust and extensible software, this project aims to make magnetic microscopy a practical and widely used method for determining paleomagnetic directions and intensities.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Geoscientists are increasingly adopting the equivalent source method to process and interpolate magnetic data, particularly in airborne geophysical surveys. However, conventional Cartesian-based approaches face significant limitations when applied to regional and global scales due to the Earth’s curvature, which complicates data interpolation and integration. This work adapts the magnetic equivalent source method to spherical coordinates. To account for the geometric differences between Cartesian and spherical systems, we introduce modifications to the mathematical formulations. We incorporate the gradient-boosting technique to tackle computational efficiency in datasets with millions of observations. We evaluate the performance of the method through synthetic data tests, identifying conditions in which it can struggle, such as variations in data density and geological complexity. The adapted method will be integrated into open-source software, broadening its accessibility and impact.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The integration of terrestrial and satellite gravity data is a relevant methodological strategy to overcome the individual limitations of each dataset: while terrestrial data offer high resolution and capture local variations, satellite data provide broad coverage and global consistency, yet resolve only low-frequency components. This work proposes an integrated approach to interpolate and combine both datasets, aiming to generate continuous gravity grids suitable for crustal geophysical modeling. The methodology consists of interpolating, via the equivalent sources method, the differences between surface gravity observations and the values predicted at the same points by satellite models. The interpolation parameters, such as source depth and damping, are automatically selected using k-fold cross-validation. The final grid is obtained by recombining these differences with the regular satellite-derived grid at constant altitude. Normal gravity is computed based on the GRS80 ellipsoid, and gravity disturbance is used as the reference field for Bouguer and isostatic corrections, both implemented through direct modeling with prisms. Topography and geological layers are discretized on regular meshes to enable spectral and spatially consistent corrections. The proposed technique yields a high-resolution, harmonic, physically consistent, and statistically validated interpolated model. The interpolation of differences ensures spectral compatibility between datasets, while prism-based modeling enables the application of gravity corrections even in geologically complex areas. Its application in a case study over the Southern Mantiqueira Province demonstrated its effectiveness in integrating heterogeneous data and recovering crustal features hidden beneath sedimentary cover. The results indicate that the approach is robust and replicable, and can be applied to other regions and for various structural investigation purposes.

Finally, the method is being incorporated into open-source software, aiming to broaden its accessibility and facilitate its use in future geophysical applications.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Paleomagnetism uses magnetic signals in minerals to study Earth’s geodynamic history, but conventional methods average magnetization over bulk samples, limiting spatial resolution. Magnetic microscopy, such as with Quantum Diamond Microscopes (QDM), enables measurement of magnetic fields from individual grains. This project introduces Magali, an open-source Python package for processing and inversion of magnetic microscopy data for paleomagnetic applications. Magali implements a workflow to automatically detect magnetic sources and estimate their magnetic moments. The workflow includes total gradient amplitude calculation, source detection using Laplacian of Gaussian filters, position estimation through Euler deconvolution, and moment estimation using both linear and nonlinear inversion. The nonlinear approach applies the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to refine source locations and dipole moments estimates. Magali is developed as part of the Fatiando a Terra project, released under a BSD license, and distributed through standard package distribution channels. It includes documentation structured according to the Divio system and supports reproducible, code-driven workflows. By providing tools tailored to QDM data, Magali complements the  open-source software landscape for magnetic microscopy and enables the recovery of paleomagnetic directions and intensities from individual grains.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> O presente trabalho tem como objetivo aplicar o método gravimétrico para delimitar os terrenos tectono-estratigráficos da Província Mantiqueira Meridional. Essa província geológica, formada durante a Orogênese Brasiliana, é subdividida nos segmentos setentrional, central e meridional, cada um caracterizado por cinturões orogênicos distintos. O estudo busca aprimorar a compreensão da continuidade lateral das estruturas e dos terrenos ocultos por sedimentos, utilizando dados gravimétricos para integrar a Província Mantiqueira ao embasamento da Bacia do Paraná. Os terrenos tectono- estratigráficos são conjuntos de rochas delimitados por falhas, que se diferenciam por suas estratigrafias e contextos geológicos. O Cinturão Dom Feliciano é composto pelos terrenos Nico Pérez/Taquarembó, São Gabriel, Tijucas, Punta del Este e pelo Batólito Florianópolis- Pelotas-Aiguá. Devido à cobertura sedimentar, grande parte desses terrenos permanece pouco definida, exigindo o uso de métodos indiretos, como a gravimetria, para sua investigação. A pesquisa utiliza dados gravimétricos obtidos por instituições como Petrobras, ANP, IBGE e Observatório Nacional, organizados pelo Banco Nacional de Dados Gravimétricos (BNDG). Para o processamento e a análise, foram empregadas ferramentas computacionais baseadas em Python, como as bibliotecas Boule e Harmonica. O distúrbio da gravidade, calculado na superfície terrestre, foi utilizado em substituição à anomalia de Ar Livre. A correção de Bouguer, tradicionalmente aplicada às anomalias de Ar Livre, foi empregada no distúrbio da gravidade, resultando no chamado Distúrbio de Bouguer. O gradeamento dos dados foi realizado por meio do método das fontes equivalentes. Filtros de realce foram aplicados aos dados processados para destacar estruturas geológicas específicas, como bordas de contatos litológicos e anomalias de densidade associadas a processos intrusivos e metamórficos. Para a interpretação dos dados, os resultados geofísicos foram comparados com mapas geológicos regionais do Serviço Geológico do Brasil (SGB/CPRM), visando à integração entre informações geofísicas e geológicas. Como resultado, foi elaborado um arcabouço geofísico-estrutural integrado preliminar, que permitiu identificar as principais feições estruturais da Província Mantiqueira Meridional, contribuindo para a compreensão da evolução crustal e da geodinâmica regional.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In a terrestrial gravity database, each data unit results from a field measurement conducted by an individual. Given the manual and labor-intensive nature of data acquisition, a high variability in measurement accuracy is assumed. Since these are geospatial data, filtering out discrepant values is a challenging process, as an anomalous value must be evaluated in relation to its neighbors but cannot be directly compared to areas with different geological contexts within the study region. The remaining alternative is to manually identify outlier points, a process analogous to the selective screening of impurities in a granular dataset. However, in large databases, the manual method, besides being laborious, does not ensure the effective removal of all anomalous values relative to their neighbors. Typically, the last outliers persist until the final processing stages, being identified only by the "spike" effect they produce in the interpolated grid. Ideally, a data analysis method should not only be automated but also allow control and traceability of the modifications, eliminating the subjectivity of manual selection. This study proposes an iterative weighting technique based on the equivalent source method to mitigate the effects of outliers in gravity data interpolation. The developed code implements an interpolation method based on equivalent sources (EquivalentSourcesGB), designed to reduce the impact of significantly discrepant data points. The function starts by receiving the coordinates and observed values of the data, along with parameters such as source depth, damping, and the maximum number of iterations. The process iteratively refines the interpolation by adjusting the estimated weights in each cycle. Based on misfit values—the difference between observed and predicted values—the weights are recalculated to minimize the influence of outlier points. Two methods are available for weight adjustment: the inverse of the absolute residual value or the inverse of its square. To prevent division by zero, only residuals above a defined tolerance are considered. In each iteration, the function also evaluates the stability of the process using a logarithmic analysis of the standard deviations of the residuals. If the derivative of the fitted logarithmic curve falls below a predefined threshold, the process is deemed stable, and the iterations are terminated. The loop stops when stability is achieved or when the maximum number of iterations is reached. At the end, the function returns the final adjusted weight vector, reflecting the reduced influence of outliers on the interpolation. This approach preserves most of the data while mitigating the negative effects of outliers, making the process more robust and reliable. Statistical data processing is an essential step in any scientific endeavor. In the case of geophysical data, an effective approach must consider the First Law of Geography: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things." The method presented in this study incorporates this perspective by handling outliers in an iterative and quantitative manner using the equivalent source method. The technique was tested with real gravity data from the south-central region of Brazil and demonstrated effectiveness in improving the quality of the interpolated grid.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study presents a method to define the ideal spatial resolution of the regular grid in the interpolation of irregularly distributed gravity data. In sparse gravity data, the heterogeneous spatial distribution of points can exacerbate interpolation errors if the grid spacing is not well-defined. Traditional methods rely on arbitrary choices or manual analyses, whereas the approach presented here automates the selection of the optimal resolution. Fractal dimension is a widely used tool to describe irregular and self-similar structures, proving useful in characterizing the density and homogeneity of gravity data networks. Based on the concepts described by Keating (1992) in "Determination of the Optimum Gridding Interval of a Gravity Data Set", the method applied here utilizes fractal dimension analysis via the Box-Counting geometric algorithm to identify the grid resolution that minimizes the distortion of interpolated data. The grid spacing (box size), 𝜹, is related to the number of filled boxes, N(𝜹), by N(𝜹) ∝ 𝜹⁻ᴰ, where D is the fractal dimension. The optimized grid interval is identified at the point where the distribution of points ceases to exhibit fractal characteristics and assumes a Euclidean behavior. This transition occurs when the slope of the log(𝜹)-log(N(𝜹)) graph reaches −2. The method was implemented in Python, using computational tools such as KD trees (k-d tree) for proximity calculations, log-log transformations for scale analysis, and numerical derivatives for inflection point identification. The workflow follows three main steps: computing box sizes, counting the number of boxes filled with at least one gravity station, and identifying the inflection point in the log(𝜹)-log(N(𝜹)) graph. The box sizes are defined based on the planimetric distances between points and their nearest neighbors. These distances are calculated, compiled, and divided into percentiles (quartiles or deciles). Each interval is then subdivided into smaller sizes, with the number of subdivisions being proportional to the square root of the interval’s range. The generated intervals are finally concatenated to form the final list of box sizes. For each value in this list, the space is divided, and the number of filled boxes is counted. In the inflection point identification step in the log-log graph, the values of 𝜹 and N(𝜹) are transformed into a logarithmic scale. Next, the slope between consecutive points on the curve is computed using the numerical derivative. The inflection point is defined as the first point where the curve's slope reaches or falls below the −2 threshold. Finally, the function returns the 𝜹 value corresponding to the inflection point, which represents the optimized grid interval. The method was tested on terrestrial gravity data from the south-central region of Brazil and on synthetic data. The results demonstrated its effectiveness, yielding consistent values for the grid interval, such as the 13,664 m value calculated for the south-central Brazil gravity network (Figure 1). However, some limitations were observed. When following an increasing sequence of box sizes, the inflection point tends to be reached earlier when a larger number of variations is tested. However, if the total number of variations is too high, the log-log graph may exhibit abrupt deviations at specific points, making the precise identification of the inflection point more challenging.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Este trabalho apresenta uma metodologia integrada para modelagem gravimétrica na Bacia do Paraná, com foco na discretização tridimensional de unidades geológicas e na aplicação do método de backstripping. A proposta visa refinar a representação das massas subsuperficiais por meio de prismas retangulares com densidade diferencial, corrigindo limitações da abordagem topográfica tradicional que assume densidade constante acima da superfície de referência. A espessura total dos sedimentos é obtida por interpolação de dados vetoriais provenientes do mapa tectônico da América do Sul, do modelo Crust 1.0 e do modelo GlobSed v3. Após reprojeção, recorte espacial e fusão controlada por distância mínima, os dados são interpolados sobre uma malha regular por meio de splines. Camadas específicas são posteriormente isoladas e refinadas. A unidade magmática Serra Geral é caracterizada com base em dois conjuntos principais: curvas isópacas (espessura) e curvas de contorno estrutural da superfície superior do Aquífero Guarani, utilizadas como base do basalto. As grades geradas passam por ajustes condicionais que impõem coerência estratigráfica com os limites do embasamento e da topografia. As espessuras das principais unidades — sedimentos totais, basaltos, cobertura acima dos basaltos e sedimentos abaixo dos basaltos — são calculadas a partir da diferença entre superfícies interpoladas, com truncamento de valores negativos. Em seguida, essas camadas são convertidas em modelos prismáticos tridimensionais, nos quais a densidade diferencial é atribuída ponto a ponto apenas quando há espessura positiva. Cada conjunto representa, assim, uma camada de correção gravitacional que pode ser somada ou subtraída do campo de Bouguer, possibilitando uma recuperação mais fiel da assinatura geofísica do embasamento. A discretização é realizada com auxílio da biblioteca Harmonica, gerando modelos em formato NetCDF compatíveis com ferramentas de processamento geofísico. O pipeline, desenvolvido inteiramente em Python, é automatizado e reprodutível, permitindo análises multiescalares com versões de alta e baixa frequência espectral. A metodologia demonstra especial eficácia em contextos como o da Bacia do Paraná, onde a presença da unidade máfica Serra Geral impõe contrastes densitários significativos. Ao integrar interpolação geológica, ajustes estruturais condicionais e modelagem prismática com backstripping, o fluxo proposto fornece uma base robusta para análises gravimétricas refinadas, contribuindo para a construção de modelos crustais mais consistentes e geologicamente embasados

          <p><strong>About:</strong> I teach the lithosphere dynamics half of the ENVS398 module,
the other half being the mantle and core covered by Andy Biggin.
In my section, we take a look at the Earth's lithosphere from a
geophysical point of view. We cover available global datasets (gravity,
magnetics, topography/bathymetry, heat flow, seismic) and geophysical
models that seek to explain these observations.
The teaching resources include short lectures and computational
practicals using Python to explore real data and generate model
predictions.
The slides for lectures are create with
<a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a> so they can be easily kept
under version control and shared with students in HTML form (hosted on
GitHub Pages).
The practicals are organized into Jupyter notebooks with annotations and
the prerequisite code. During delivery of the practicals, I start with
a blank version of the notebook and type out the code while I explain
what I'm doing. This helps control my pacing and make sure students are
engaged following along.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is a bit of a strage module.
During the first 4 weeks of ENVS258, I teach a crash-course on satellite
remote sensing, including multispectral images, LiDAR and DEMs, and InSAR.
There is a practical focus and students learn how to manipulate these data
using scientific Python tools. The highlight of this part of the module is
the report they have to produce by choosing their own study region,
downloading public domain imagery, processing it in Python, and writing up
their results. Some of the reports are truly inspiring (I've incorporated
some into the practicals) and they are always a pleasure to read and
provide feedback.
The next 4 weeks are a field-based course in Everton Park where students
get to use every piece of geophysics kit we have (GPR, seismic, dGPS,
magnetic gradiometry, EM31, ERT), each taught by a different lecturer (I
was in charge of the GPR).

<a href="https://softwareunderground.org/">Software Underground</a>'s
yearly festival of open geoscience:
<a href="https://transform.softwareunderground.org/">Transform</a>.
You can read the tutorial directly on this website at
<a href="/blog/midocean-ridges.html">"A geophysical tour of mid-ocean ridges"</a>.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mid-ocean ridges are the places where the oceanic crust and lithosphere
are born. They are large mountain ranges in the deep ocean, stretching
all around the globe and with heights rivalling that of the tallest
mountains on land. Ridges are also a key part of plate tectonics, a major
component of the biogeochemical cycle of the oceans, and the home of
unique biological communities.
In this tutorial, we'll study the mid-ocean ridges through the lens of
geophysics. We'll use open geophysical data (gravity, bathymetry, lithospheric
age) and open-source Python tools to try to answer questions like: How do
ridges stay so tall? Are they in isostatic equilibrium? Why do ocean basins
get deeper as they age? Along the way, we'll also learn how to translate into
code the physical models of the cooling of the lithosphere so that we can
compare their predictions with our data.

Transform event, an online series of open-access and open-source
tutorials about coding and geoscience.
The live video was streamed on YouTube and participants asked questions
on the Slack workspace, where volunteers would help them along and
pass on any feedback to me.
The format worked quite well and the video because a useful reference for
novices getting into Fatiando a Terra.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This tutorial will be a hands-on tour of
<a href="https://www.fatiando.org/verde">Verde</a>, a Python package for
processing and gridding geophysical/geospatial data with a twist of
machine learning. We'll start with a real dataset and work our way
towards producing one or more gridded products. The way there will take
us through: loading some data, generating and handling coordinates and
projections (using pyproj), splitting training and testing data for
validation, data decimation with blocked means/medians to avoid aliasing,
2D trend estimation, gridding with bi-harmonic splines, combining
everything into a data processing pipeline, cross-validation of data
distributed spatially on the Earth (including parallel execution with
Dask).

          <p><strong>About:</strong> I taught this short online course (3 hours) for the Aachen graduate
school on invitation by <a href="https://www.cgre.rwth-aachen.de/cms/CGRE/Das-Lehr-und-Forschungsgebiet/~dnyyj/Prof-Wellmann/">Prof. Florian Wellman</a>.
I tried to give it a very hands-on spin where we attempted to code a
non-linear gravity inversion live.
It worked out much better than I expected!
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inverse problems abound in geophysics. It is the primary way in which we
investigate the subsurface of the Earth, which is largely inaccessible to
us beyond the first dozen or so kilometers. From measurements acquired on
land, sea, air, and from space, geophysicists tease out the inner
structure of the Earth - from a few meters to thousands of kilometers
deep in the inner core. Observations of disturbances in the Earth's
gravity field are one of the key elements used by geophysicists to
investigate the crust-mantle interface, the large-scale structure of
sedimentary basins (which are reservoirs for water and hydrocarbons), and
even the mass balance of the world's ice sheets. However, the gravity
inverse problem is particularly challenging due to the physics of
potential fields. Unique solutions are difficult to come by and only
exist under strict assumptions, which often don't hold for real world
scenarios. For these problems, regularization plays a critical role and
has been the focus of much research in the past 20 years.
In this tutorial, we will work together to solve a 2D gravity inverse
problem in Python. Our code will estimate the shape of a sedimentary
basin from gravity observations. This non-linear inverse problem will
allow us to visually explore the effects of different types of
regularization from a geometric perspective (smoothness, equality
constraints, and more). We will discuss the challenges involved in real
world applications and the difficulties of quantifying the uncertainty in
the solutions. The main goal of this tutorial is to impart theoretical
and practical skills that can be easily transfered to other domains.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This is the second edition of our open-source best practices workshop
at AGU. Follwing the success of the 2018 workshop, we proposed it again
with slight modifications. This year's workshop was organized by

</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Modern research software is the basis of scientific progress in
geophysics by supporting data collection, data analysis, and numerical
simulation. These codes span the range from small one-off scripts
developed by individual researchers up to large packages with thousands
of users. While there is increasing awareness about best programming
practices, scientists are rarely prepared to scale their codes into team
projects developed by larger communities. However, growing a sustainable
software project and the community of practice that surrounds it is a
prerequisite to make scientific software development more efficient and
research more reproducible.
The open-source community has established modern best-practices for
developing reliable software, publishing that software, forming
communities around the code, and finding sustainable ways to maintain
them over time. This hands-on half-day workshop is aimed at scientists
currently developing their own software of any size. The participants
will apply a workflow for developing and managing open-source research
codes following best-practices. We will discuss licensing and privacy
considerations for open-source projects in a scientific context, briefly
review version control with git and hosting projects online, and teach
how to automatically test and efficiently document code. Furthermore, we
will discuss how to grow projects and manage communities around it. The
course material is independent of programming language or scientific
discipline. By the end of this workshop participants will be able to
apply the gained knowledge directly to their own projects and create more
sustainable research software.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> This half-day workshop was taught at the 2018 AGU Fall Meeting in
Washington DC, USA. Our goal was to help people who are already programming
and want to take the next step towards developing open-source software.
</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Modern science increasingly relies on code, ranging from small scripts to
workflows with many interacting parts. Reproducibility and extension of
studies employing these codes require that they are accessible. The
open-source community has established modern best-practices for making
software available, usable, and maintainable. In this workshop, we will
demonstrate a workflow for publishing research code following these
best-practices. We will cover open-source licenses, version control,
automated testing, documentation, and continuous integration. The
workshop will be hands-on: participants will work to set up a project
using sample code provided by the instructors. By the end, participants
will have the knowledge needed to continue learning independently and
apply these practices to their own research code. These resources can be
applied to any programming language or scientific discipline.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> I started working with Santiago in 2015 when he made his first contribution
to <a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a>. A bit after
that, he invited me to co-advise his PhD thesis and I was very happy to
accept. We worked on several new methods for inversion and modeling of
gravity data and Santiago is now one of the main developers and leaders of
the Fatiando a Terra project. The entire PhD supervision was done remotely,
through chat and weekly catch-up video calls.

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> En esta Tesis presentamos dos nuevas metodologías para el modelado y
procesamiento de datos gravimétricos. La primera consiste en un método para
el modelado directo de los campos gravitatorios generados por teseroides de
densidades que varían de manera continua en la dirección radial. Este
resuelve las integrales volumétricas involucradas mediante una Cuadratura de
Gauss-Legendre junto a un algoritmo de discretización adaptativa
bidimensional y un nuevo algoritmo de discretización basado en la densidad.
La segunda metodología consiste en las fuentes equivalentes potenciadas por
gradiente, las cuales permiten realizar interpolaciones y continuaciones
ascendentes de grandes cantidades de datos gravimétricos mediante la técnica
de fuentes equivalentes en conjunto con un algoritmo de potenciación del
gradiente. Ambas metodologías fueron aplicadas sobre datos reales: se utilizó
el nuevo modelo directo de teseroides para modelar la Cuenca Neuquina
(Argentina) con un perfil de densidad exponencial, y mediantes las fuentes
equivalentes potenciadas por el gradiente conseguimos grillar un conjunto de
más de 1.7 millones de datos de gravedad sobre la superficie de Australia.
Por último, presentamos un recorrido sobre el desarrollo del proyecto de
software de código abierto para Geofísica: Fatiando a Terra. Recorremos su
historia, describimos los paquetes que forman parte del proyecto y
enumeramos las mejores prácticas que se aplican para poder desarrollarlas.
Además intentamos evaluar qué impacto posee el proyecto sobre la comunidad
geocientista internacional, cómo los y las integrantes de la comunidad de
Fatiando a Terra interactúan entre sí y cómo lo hacen con las otras
comunidades de software científico.

          <p><strong>Conference:</strong> EGU General Assembly</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent years, the geoscience community has been making strides towards
making our science more open, inclusive, and accessible, driven both by
individual- or community-led initiatives and by broader-scale regulatory
changes. Open-source software, accessible codebases and open online
collaboration resources (such as GitHub, VHub, etc.) are becoming the norm
in many disciplines. The open-access publishing landscape has been changing
too: several geoscience journals have defined data availability policies,
and many publishers have introduced green and gold open-access options to
their journal collections. Pre-print servers and grassroots diamond
open-access journals are changing the readiness with which scholarly
content can be accessed beyond the traditional paywall model.
However, good scientific practice requires research results to be
reproducible, experiments to be repeatable and methods to be reusable. This
can be a challenge in geosciences, with available data sets that are
becoming more complex and constantly superseded by new, improved releases.
Similarly, new models and computational tools keep emerging in different
versions and programming languages, with a large variability in the quality
of the documentation. Moreover, how data and models are linked together
towards scientific output is very rarely documented in a reproducible way.
As a result, very few published results are reproducible for the general
reader. These challenges especially apply to hydrology, which is
highlighted here as an example in the general geosciences.
This session is designed to gain a community overview of the current
open-science landscape and how this is expected to evolve in the future. It
aims to foster a debate on open science, lower the bar for engaging in open
science and showcase examples, including software and other instruments for
assisting open research. This may include software and tools, open science
dissemination platforms (such as pre-print servers and journals), the teams
driving the development of open-science resources and practices, and
discussion on the regulatory moves towards standardising open access in the
scientific community and what those policies mean in practice. The session
has a focus on hydrological sciences, as an example within the geosciences.
This session should advance the discussion on open and reproducible
science, highlight its advantages and also provide the means to bring this
into practice.

          <p><strong>Conference:</strong> AGU Fall Meeting</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Open-source software is ubiquitous in modern scientific research and is
only becoming more critical as the Earth Sciences move into the era of data
science and cloud computing. Last year, we held a town hall on “The role of
an open-source software initiative within the AGU” in which we discussed
some of the technical and social challenges facing software developers and
maintainers. We collectively identified 3 action-items: (1) work with AGU
to have “software submissions” at the Fall Meeting, so that authors can
submit a first-author science-focused abstract and a first-author
software-focused abstract, (2) assemble resources on best-practices for
modern research software development, (3) find mechanisms to elevate the
role of software maintenance and development in AGU outlets, such as blogs
and EOS articles. In this year’s community town hall, we will share our
progress, provide trajectories for new contributors to get involved, and
discuss priorities and new action-items for the Open Source Software
Initiative in 2020.

available for researchers in the geosciences. The fast-growing open source
software ecosystem is creating new tools and changing paradigms for how
computers and collaborations are used to study Earth processes. If you have
written open-source software that could be useful to others, we look
forward to seeing your submission. This session will not only be an
opportunity to showcase your own packages and learn  about other available
tools, we also hope it will be an opportunity to connect with others
working on related problems and lead to opportunities to form new
collaborations. The session will be accompanied by a posters where the
audience can engage individually with the presenters. We welcome
submissions from all domains.

          <p><strong>Conference:</strong> AGU Fall Meeting</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Software is now an essential part of almost any scientific research
conducted. The spectrum of software used by scientists on a daily basis
ranges from “mundane” data parsers, to numerical simulations, which solve a
partial differential equation, to highly domain-specific tools for data
analysis. The growth of the open-source software ecosystem has increased
the availability of tools. Importantly, as more researchers open-source
their software, there is less duplication of efforts in the development of
routine tasks, strides are being made to improve reproducibility of
results, and the ability of other researchers to build upon and extend work
is greatly accelerated. As such, we see that open-source software is
critical to the future of research in the geosciences. Therefore, we
propose to start an Open-Source Software Initiative (OSSI) within the AGU.
In this community forum, we would like to present our vision for the role
of the OSSI and solicit feedback and ideas from the wider community.
